Tom has been de@@ ta@@ ined by the po@@ lice .
your name is fa@@ mi@@ li@@ a@@ r to me .
it is com@@ pu@@ ted at 1@@ 0@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 y@@ en .
today I have a lot of things to do .
I stu@@ died for a year in Boston .
it doesn &apos;t look good for Tom .
he doesn &apos;t go to school any@@ more .
I couldn &apos;t believe my ears !
should I open the windo@@ ws ?
d@@ ur@@ ing my last sp@@ r@@ ing v@@ ac@@ ation I took a job in a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant to help p@@ ay the c@@ os@@ ts of my tri@@ p ab@@ road .
and , they &apos;ve already t@@ or@@ n up the gar@@ d@@ en .
they make to@@ ys at this f@@ ac@@ t@@ or@@ y .
she almost got away with it .
I already told you .
the la@@ dy w@@ ear@@ ing s@@ un@@ gl@@ as@@ ses seem@@ ed very str@@ ang@@ e .
where &apos;s the b@@ each ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know how to play the b@@ ass gu@@ it@@ a@@ r .
she sp@@ read h@@ on@@ ey th@@ ic@@ k@@ ly on her to@@ a@@ st .
do you sp@@ end more time with your friends or with your family ?
no one who is a de@@ cent hu@@ man being could pos@@ si@@ b@@ ly sup@@ por@@ t this pro@@ j@@ ect .
first of all , po@@ wer off your c@@ el@@ l@@ ph@@ on@@ es and re@@ ma@@ in s@@ il@@ ent .
he deci@@ ded that if G@@ o@@ d didn &apos;t ex@@ i@@ st then everything was per@@ m@@ it@@ ted .
get ri@@ d of her .
swi@@ mm@@ ing re@@ gu@@ lar@@ ly is good for your heal@@ th .
the woman sle@@ ep@@ s in the be@@ d@@ room .
open the door !
does Tom have a hun@@ ting li@@ cen@@ se ?
where was Tom wor@@ king then ?
he is no lon@@ ger a boy .
that &apos;s quite me@@ an@@ in@@ g@@ less .
Tom isn &apos;t a very n@@ ice gu@@ y .
you are not at all what I exp@@ ec@@ ted .
that wasn &apos;t such a bad idea .
will you be doing that again ?
Tom seems un@@ sure .
too good to be true .
I remember both of you .
he gave up going ab@@ road to stu@@ dy because of his father &apos;s su@@ dd@@ en death .
he sh@@ ined his sho@@ es .
how much is the mon@@ th@@ ly r@@ ate ?
we took ad@@ v@@ an@@ t@@ age of the f@@ ine wea@@ ther to play ten@@ n@@ is .
we could sure do with some rain .
aren &apos;t you going to sing ?
then you just have to f@@ ill out this car@@ d .
Tom told me what happened .
there was not a cl@@ ou@@ d in the s@@ k@@ y .
I can &apos;t ra@@ i@@ se our child by my@@ self .
they &apos;re not afraid of hard work .
this time , you &apos;ve cr@@ os@@ sed the l@@ ine !
you should try to make the most of your op@@ port@@ un@@ it@@ ies .
did anyone see you come in ?
Tom can no lon@@ ger live here .
Tom died of li@@ ver can@@ c@@ er .
it app@@ ears to me you &apos;re mista@@ ken .
are you a tre@@ k@@ ki@@ e ?
the pro@@ j@@ ec@@ tor doesn &apos;t work .
I ju@@ d@@ g@@ ed you too qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .

d@@ ry w@@ ood b@@ ur@@ n@@ s well .
Tom was off@@ ered a lea@@ ding ro@@ le in a h@@ or@@ r@@ or mo@@ vi@@ e .
there &apos;s no one by that name here .
Mary k@@ ept ch@@ ec@@ king her watch .
you must star@@ t soon .
it &apos;s s@@ no@@ w@@ ing there .
in con@@ tra@@ st to yesterday , it isn &apos;t ho@@ t at all today .
it happened so fast .
I need to speak with you right away .
I hel@@ d my b@@ re@@ at@@ h and wa@@ ited .

what time does the st@@ ore open ?
I know that it is hi@@ gh@@ ly un@@ li@@ k@@ ely that we &apos;ll see any wh@@ al@@ es today .
this is a ni@@ gh@@ t@@ m@@ are .
today p@@ il@@ o@@ t f@@ ati@@ gu@@ e seems more li@@ k@@ ely .
the best way to cat@@ ch a train on time is to make sure to mis@@ s the one that pre@@ ce@@ d@@ es it .
there &apos;s no need to be afraid .
the stor@@ m let up .
I &apos;ll get right on it .
the person who wants nothing , ho@@ p@@ es for nothing , and f@@ ears nothing can never be an ar@@ ti@@ st .
he has red hair and f@@ rec@@ k@@ les .
you &apos;re with Tom , aren &apos;t you ?
Tom couldn &apos;t believe his good for@@ t@@ un@@ e .
Tom found Mary &apos;s di@@ ary .
we had brea@@ k@@ fast .
Tom is a fast ea@@ ter .
Tom is good , isn &apos;t he ?
I &apos;ve no pro@@ of to the con@@ tr@@ ary .

it is car@@ el@@ ess of you to say such things .
I &apos;ll put some s@@ al@@ t on the me@@ at .
Mary told John the se@@ cre@@ t .
he says we should go that way .
Tom and Mary told John that they thought Alice was thir@@ st@@ y .
there were some stud@@ ents in the cl@@ as@@ s@@ room .
I &apos;d like to help you .
tell him where he should go .
you should never ask a woman how old she is .
no one exp@@ ec@@ ted her to w@@ in .
the s@@ qu@@ ir@@ re@@ l is the gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an sp@@ ir@@ it of our tri@@ be .
the P@@ an@@ the@@ on is now a ch@@ ur@@ ch .

Tom is a car me@@ ch@@ an@@ ic .
Tom is good at ch@@ ess , too .
I already said no .
it wasn &apos;t wor@@ th as much as they were ch@@ ar@@ g@@ ing for it .
didn &apos;t you mis@@ s anything ?
she really got on my n@@ er@@ ves .
we ate a ha@@ st@@ y m@@ ea@@ l and left im@@ me@@ di@@ at@@ ely .

Tom is s@@ ha@@ ving .
her youn@@ ge@@ st child is fi@@ ve years old .
how could you do that ?
she has a ma@@ g@@ ne@@ ti@@ c per@@ s@@ on@@ al@@ ity .
Tom seems in@@ sin@@ c@@ ere .
it &apos;s as if Tom and Mary were made for each other .
they don &apos;t want us to see what they &apos;re doing .
I feel like a drink .
I can no lon@@ ger stand this no@@ i@@ se .
I &apos;m ho@@ l@@ ding in my han@@ ds a book by S@@ u@@ s@@ an@@ n@@ a T@@ a@@ mar@@ o .
if I were you , I would wa@@ it and see .

he knows how to f@@ ly a h@@ e@@ li@@ co@@ p@@ ter .
you re@@ mind me of my son .
I read this book when I was in col@@ le@@ ge .
Tom loved b@@ an@@ an@@ as .
a pen@@ ci@@ l is st@@ ic@@ king out of your po@@ ck@@ et .
if only I were such a beautiful and tal@@ en@@ ted person .
I think it must &apos;ve been Tom who s@@ ent Mary that no@@ te .
the h@@ eat was un@@ be@@ ar@@ able .

I &apos;m not de@@ f@@ en@@ ding him .

Tom as@@ sur@@ ed Mary that he &apos;d help her pa@@ int the ce@@ il@@ ing of her k@@ it@@ ch@@ en .

I wish I had more f@@ ree time .
Tom is the same age as I am .
K@@ i@@ m is f@@ our years ol@@ der than me .
Mary wouldn &apos;t go to Boston if she didn &apos;t have to .
this me@@ dic@@ ine will give you some re@@ lie@@ f .
that was a ter@@ ri@@ ble thing you said to Tom .
the bo@@ x was so hea@@ v@@ y that I couldn &apos;t li@@ ft it .
don &apos;t sh@@ oo@@ t me . I &apos;m only the tr@@ ans@@ lat@@ or .

I will b@@ ear your wor@@ ds in mind .
live and learn .

work qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly , eat s@@ low@@ ly .
he died yesterday .
Tom must &apos;ve kno@@ wn this would happ@@ en .
she is as@@ ha@@ med of what she &apos;s done .
can you give me a b@@ ri@@ e@@ f des@@ cri@@ p@@ tion of the th@@ i@@ e@@ f ?

we are b@@ ra@@ ying like d@@ on@@ k@@ e@@ ys .
this time , you &apos;ve cr@@ os@@ sed the l@@ ine !
T@@ e@@ ch@@ n@@ ic@@ ally he is still a stu@@ dent .
Tom la@@ id his ba@@ g on the table .

he sup@@ por@@ ted himself with a st@@ ic@@ k .
ma@@ y@@ be Tom should stay here with Mary .
I will only buy the car if they re@@ pa@@ ir the b@@ ra@@ kes first .
if it were not for the su@@ n , we would all di@@ e .
all you have to do is write a few sen@@ ten@@ ces about what you did yesterday .
the small se@@ ed be@@ came a lar@@ ge t@@ ree .
does any@@ body else know about this ?
Tom asked Mary for John &apos;s tel@@ ep@@ h@@ one nu@@ mber .
you can be such a d@@ ra@@ m@@ a qu@@ e@@ en , Tom .
we know how Tom is .
sh@@ ouldn &apos;t we be doing something to help Tom ?
the old man ser@@ ved the king for many years .
everything that Tom said is true .
take what you like .
Tom seem@@ ed to have re@@ co@@ ver@@ ed .

she con@@ f@@ es@@ sed her love to him .
I &apos;m so tired !
Tom wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed something to Mary that I couldn &apos;t hear .
I i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine that Tom will e@@ ven@@ tu@@ ally ru@@ n out of money and have to go back home .
she is d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing a picture .
how long do you think Tom will work for us before he qu@@ its and go@@ es to an@@ other comp@@ any ?
in B@@ r@@ it@@ ain the M@@ e@@ tr@@ o is kno@@ wn as the U@@ n@@ der@@ gr@@ ound , not as the su@@ b@@ way .
we &apos;ll use what we have .
he fell from one ex@@ tre@@ me to the other .
when did you come back from Ger@@ many ?
Tom said that he was ang@@ ry .
you &apos;re prob@@ ab@@ ly as very tal@@ en@@ ted as I am !
I &apos;d like to buy a ma@@ p .
he did nothing wrong .
you can &apos;t es@@ c@@ ap@@ e .
that was a fu@@ n con@@ ver@@ s@@ ation .
I couldn &apos;t have said it better my@@ self .

this can@@ c@@ er is in@@ c@@ ur@@ able .
who could b@@ la@@ me me ?
I don &apos;t think she is happy .
why didn &apos;t you use a p@@ ay phone ?
I had a st@@ ro@@ ke last year .
do you sp@@ end most of your time wor@@ r@@ ying about things that don &apos;t matter so much ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to buy my da@@ ugh@@ ter a de@@ cent com@@ pu@@ ter .
what &apos;s your fav@@ or@@ ite i@@ ma@@ ge e@@ d@@ iting so@@ f@@ tw@@ are ?
the con@@ cer@@ t wasn &apos;t all that great .
might I ask your name and ad@@ dress ?
I remember your face , but I don &apos;t remember your name .
I st@@ ep@@ ped car@@ e@@ fu@@ l@@ ly on the ac@@ c@@ el@@ er@@ at@@ or .
N@@ on@@ on likes s@@ ci@@ ence f@@ ic@@ tion .
I &apos;ll go get it for you .
Tom used a c@@ row@@ ba@@ r to p@@ ry open the li@@ d of the cr@@ ate .
Tom at@@ t@@ ac@@ ked Mary .
Tom and Mary li@@ ed about why they were fir@@ ed .
do you remember what C@@ a@@ th@@ y was w@@ ear@@ ing at the party ?
why doesn &apos;t she write me any@@ more ?
Tom doesn &apos;t want to have to f@@ ight you .
I was won@@ der@@ ing if you were going to s@@ how up today .
O@@ u@@ ch ! a ch@@ est@@ nu@@ t fell on my hea@@ d .
why is he ang@@ ry about something like that ?
can she come to the meeting tomorrow ?
I thought I would find happ@@ in@@ ess there .
Tom asked us to help him .

con@@ si@@ der what should be done , de@@ ter@@ m@@ ine what can be done and do what nee@@ ds to be done .
we spo@@ ke for about three hours .
do you know how to use this ca@@ mer@@ a ?
we think the reason for his su@@ cc@@ ess was because of hard work .
when the bo@@ mb@@ s fell on our h@@ ar@@ b@@ or and t@@ y@@ r@@ an@@ n@@ y th@@ re@@ at@@ ened the world , she was there to w@@ it@@ ne@@ ss a g@@ en@@ er@@ ation ri@@ se to gre@@ at@@ ne@@ ss , and a de@@ mo@@ cr@@ ac@@ y was sa@@ ved . Y@@ es , we can .

he has tw@@ en@@ ty children .
I know Tom hel@@ ped you .
first , we will pres@@ ent a pe@@ t@@ it@@ ion to the ma@@ yo@@ r and col@@ le@@ c@@ t si@@ g@@ n@@ at@@ u@@ res .
I &apos;ll take this to Tom .

Tom got very ang@@ ry with Mary .
I won &apos;t l@@ ose anything .
the bu@@ d@@ get app@@ ears to be in@@ ac@@ c@@ ur@@ ate and un@@ re@@ ali@@ st@@ ic .
try on both these co@@ at@@ s and comp@@ are them .
I asked Tom to call you .
I should &apos;ve be@@ come a teacher .
don &apos;t let him take pic@@ tu@@ res .
they took our p@@ as@@ sp@@ or@@ ts .
I know as little as you do .
Tom su@@ sta@@ ined min@@ or in@@ ju@@ ri@@ es .
W@@ o@@ w , that &apos;s so c@@ ool .
she was great .
com@@ pu@@ ter sup@@ p@@ li@@ es are very exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve in Japan .
what time is good for you ?
Tom can &apos;t stop it .
he sta@@ yed at a ho@@ te@@ l for a c@@ ou@@ ple of days .
do you want me to ask Tom to do that for you ?
Tom and Mary are no lon@@ ger on spea@@ king ter@@ ms .
I go to work every day .
C@@ on@@ so@@ le yourself with that .
that room is not very lar@@ ge .
they were v@@ ac@@ ant ap@@ ar@@ t@@ m@@ ents or ho@@ mes .
today is one of my friends &apos; bir@@ th@@ day .
that man stan@@ ding n@@ ear the door and that woman on the op@@ pos@@ ite side of the room next to the windo@@ w have p@@ ho@@ to@@ gr@@ ap@@ hi@@ c me@@ mor@@ ies .
Tom bought a used car from a re@@ pu@@ table de@@ al@@ er@@ shi@@ p .
he speaks too much .
can you sol@@ ve the problem by yourself ?
U@@ h , will you ex@@ cu@@ se me ?
I &apos;m going to mar@@ ry him .
Tom was sh@@ y , but Mary wasn &apos;t .
I didn &apos;t have enough money to ren@@ t a car .
Tom p@@ ou@@ red ho@@ t water into the c@@ up .
I come from a big family .
Tom knows Mary li@@ ed .
there &apos;s no other way to do this .
I want to be able to walk down this stre@@ et without wor@@ r@@ ying about getting sho@@ t .
don &apos;t keep comp@@ any with such a bad boy .
what happened ?
he would pre@@ f@@ er to live in a de@@ vel@@ op@@ ing country because of the ex@@ change r@@ ate .
Tom l@@ ent his b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle to Mary .
the v@@ ac@@ ation is cl@@ ose to an end .
how much did you w@@ in ?
don &apos;t do anything you don &apos;t want to do .
she left the windo@@ w open .
do you have any ide@@ as about it ?
I can have din@@ ner ready by 1@@ 0 o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck .
who knows who I am ? I &apos;m con@@ stan@@ tly chang@@ ing .
you know the place .
we live , not as we wish to , but as we can .
soon , Tom lost coun@@ t of the sh@@ ee@@ p and fell as@@ le@@ ep .
Tom didn &apos;t do a very good job c@@ le@@ an@@ ing the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en f@@ loo@@ r . it &apos;s still di@@ r@@ ty .
bo@@ ys do c@@ ry .
that was very f@@ un@@ n@@ y .
if only I were as h@@ and@@ some as he is .
listen to your mother .
as he en@@ ter@@ ed the house , two things ca@@ ught his ey@@ e .
it ma@@ kes no fu@@ c@@ king sen@@ se .
Tom knew that Mary wanted John to ask Alice to do that .
the matter is all se@@ tt@@ led .
Tom didn &apos;t tell Mary to do that .
Tom fell f@@ l@@ at on the f@@ loo@@ r .
his new no@@ v@@ el will come out next mon@@ th .
re@@ la@@ x . it &apos;ll be al@@ right .
I won &apos;t need you .
in her book , &quot; I@@ n the L@@ and of I@@ n@@ ven@@ ted L@@ angu@@ ag@@ es , &quot; A@@ ri@@ k@@ a O@@ k@@ ren@@ t speaks fav@@ our@@ ab@@ ly about E@@ sp@@ er@@ an@@ to .
he hel@@ ped me to get over the diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ ti@@ es .
would you d@@ ate a man thir@@ ty years ol@@ der than you ?
Tom is sm@@ as@@ h@@ ed .
the b@@ al@@ lo@@ on was car@@ ried away some@@ where by the w@@ ind .
I po@@ in@@ ted this out to Tom .
&quot; I was just ad@@ m@@ ir@@ ing your r@@ os@@ es . they &apos;re ab@@ so@@ lu@@ t@@ ely g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous . &quot; &quot; O@@ h , I &apos;m f@@ lat@@ ter@@ ed . th@@ ank you . &quot;
Tom called me a ca@@ b .
father came home about ten minu@@ tes ag@@ o .
I cannot a@@ ff@@ or@@ d to buy a new b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle .
Mary ta@@ ught h@@ er@@ self how to do that .
she &apos;s busy . wa@@ it a little lon@@ ger .
I don &apos;t like sle@@ ep@@ ing alone .
it has never been done before .
do you tru@@ st my ju@@ d@@ g@@ ment ?
everyone is e@@ qu@@ al before the la@@ w .
I &apos;ll r@@ ing you back .
I &apos;ve kno@@ wn Tom a lot lon@@ ger than you have .

the C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an u@@ ne@@ m@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ ment r@@ ate was 7 per@@ cent in O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er of 2@@ 0@@ 1@@ 5 .
Tom and I used to be ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ s .
this gu@@ ide@@ book is the only one I found to be really u@@ se@@ ful out of all the on@@ es re@@ comm@@ en@@ ded to me .
Tom ho@@ p@@ es Mary will get well soon .
in a sen@@ se , life is but a drea@@ m .
I think the train will come soon .
nobody ans@@ w@@ ered us .
with all its s@@ ha@@ m , d@@ ru@@ d@@ g@@ er@@ y and bro@@ ken drea@@ ms ; it is still a beautiful world .
it ain &apos;t over t@@ ill it &apos;s over .
do you even remember Tom ?
he has more than fi@@ ve dic@@ ti@@ on@@ ar@@ ies .
Tom c@@ ried his ey@@ es out .
Tom &apos;s face turned red as a be@@ et .
I will come to your party this e@@ ven@@ ing .
I don &apos;t feel like doing anything when it &apos;s that ho@@ t .
I &apos;ll take this : I like the col@@ our .
they ti@@ ck@@ led each other .

let me do it my way .
I sing the s@@ ong of him wh@@ ose b@@ read I eat .
w@@ ood is the ra@@ w mat@@ er@@ i@@ al for ma@@ king p@@ aper .
the pri@@ ce was in the ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ our@@ h@@ ood of 5@@ 0 do@@ l@@ lar@@ s .
ma@@ y@@ be that &apos;s the reason .
how long was Tom there ?
you &apos;ve been through a lot .
you &apos;re a French teacher , aren &apos;t you ?
I thought everyone was busy .
I don &apos;t like getting up so early in the morning .
are you fe@@ el@@ ing up to it ?
what does this si@@ g@@ n me@@ an ?
you should cho@@ ose your friends very car@@ e@@ fu@@ l@@ ly .
don &apos;t you ever speak to me like that again .
he almost d@@ row@@ ned in the ri@@ ver .
Tom tal@@ ked Mary into going to the con@@ cer@@ t with him .
why were Tom and Mary exp@@ el@@ led from school ?
swi@@ mm@@ ing is one thing I en@@ jo@@ y .

Tom qu@@ it stud@@ ying French after just three mon@@ th@@ s .

Tom s@@ cor@@ ed a go@@ al .
have you ever been to N@@ ar@@ a ?
is that your fin@@ al de@@ c@@ is@@ ion ?
I thought there was nobody in the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en .
the pro@@ por@@ tion of the world &apos;s po@@ pu@@ l@@ ation spea@@ king English as a first language is de@@ cl@@ in@@ ing , and will con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ e to do so .
the re@@ f@@ er@@ e@@ e must be fa@@ ir to both tea@@ ms .

per@@ h@@ ap@@ s it will rain in the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on .
Tom asked if what Mary said was true .
doesn &apos;t that pro@@ ve something ?
do you want to s@@ it in the fr@@ on@@ t ?
if I were you , I would pa@@ int it b@@ lu@@ e .
he re@@ ma@@ ined s@@ il@@ ent .
I go to school by b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle .
he ear@@ n@@ s no less than three hun@@ d@@ red do@@ l@@ lar@@ s a day .
how do you know ?
I didn &apos;t tru@@ st him at first .
what was she doing in her room ?
I &apos;m tired and I want to go home .
Tom didn &apos;t des@@ er@@ ve the p@@ un@@ ish@@ ment he rec@@ ei@@ ved .
Tom and Mary had to walk school when they were ki@@ ds .
he nee@@ ded money .
he pro@@ mis@@ ed me that he wouldn &apos;t tell any@@ body .
she ad@@ ap@@ ts h@@ er@@ self to c@@ ir@@ cu@@ m@@ stan@@ ces .
Tom and Mary had a me@@ di@@ e@@ v@@ al we@@ d@@ ding .
she didn &apos;t s@@ how up .
Tom v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers at a ho@@ m@@ el@@ ess sh@@ el@@ ter t@@ wi@@ ce a week .
tell me why you did it .
that &apos;s compl@@ e@@ te n@@ on@@ sen@@ se .
pla@@ ying the pi@@ an@@ o isn &apos;t easy .
I &apos;m very g@@ la@@ d I wasn &apos;t there .
I want to play ten@@ n@@ is with you some@@ day .
Tom app@@ re@@ ci@@ ated Mary &apos;s ad@@ vi@@ ce .
you just made me s@@ mil@@ e .
there &apos;s bl@@ ood in the water .
Tom is a re@@ tired po@@ li@@ ce@@ man .
I won@@ der what happened to an@@ ci@@ ent R@@ o@@ me .
they are both very exc@@ ited .
my father used to tra@@ v@@ el .
I &apos;ll be in my off@@ ice if you need me .
give him pl@@ en@@ ty of work to do .
no work is as hard as the one you don &apos;t like to do .
he re@@ pre@@ sen@@ ted our comp@@ any at the con@@ f@@ er@@ ence .
did you keep in t@@ ou@@ ch ?
have you already made friends with her ?
why did you leave the light on in the meeting room ?
Tom wanted to ask Mary about how John died .
Tom knows what &apos;s good .
if an English spea@@ k@@ er says some@@ one is j@@ ol@@ ly , that me@@ ans they are ch@@ e@@ er@@ ful or fri@@ en@@ d@@ ly . but in French , jo@@ li@@ e me@@ ans some@@ one is good @-@ looking or plea@@ s@@ ant to look at . in any ca@@ se , both are n@@ ice things to say to some@@ one .
M@@ oh@@ and is my h@@ al@@ f brother .
are you done u@@ p@@ sta@@ ir@@ s ?
she asked me if I was all right .
hi@@ gh@@ er ta@@ x@@ es hur@@ t the e@@ con@@ o@@ my .
look at me when you &apos;re talking to me .
I &apos;ll never for@@ get how hel@@ p@@ ful you &apos;ve been .
Tom looked again .
G@@ o@@ d doesn &apos;t make mista@@ kes .
don &apos;t put the gl@@ ass n@@ ear the e@@ d@@ ge of the table .
Tom always br@@ ag@@ s about how ri@@ ch he is .
Mary is easy @-@ going and fu@@ n .
it exc@@ ee@@ ded my exp@@ ec@@ t@@ ati@@ ons .
I just fol@@ low@@ ed the re@@ ci@@ pe .
let Tom do this .
I haven &apos;t been back here since the in@@ cident .
at what time did you go to sleep yesterday ?
why don &apos;t you ask M@@ r W@@ h@@ ite ?
I know where they are .
nothing ju@@ st@@ i@@ fi@@ es their ex@@ i@@ st@@ ence .
do you understand everything ?
the gir@@ ls won .
B@@ raz@@ il is a hu@@ ge country .
Tom died O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er 2@@ 0@@ th .
Japanese is our mother t@@ on@@ gu@@ e .
he bought v@@ e@@ get@@ ab@@ les and some fr@@ u@@ it .
do you know if Tom has already ea@@ ten ?
they &apos;re afraid of us .
Mary &apos;s ey@@ es were f@@ illed with t@@ ears .
I called Tom up .
your death was not in v@@ ain .
I had my wal@@ let st@@ ol@@ en on the bu@@ s .
Tom has some food al@@ l@@ er@@ gi@@ es , so he has to be car@@ e@@ ful about what he ea@@ ts .
this man is ali@@ ve .
Mary said she thought Tom wasn &apos;t fin@@ ished doing that yet .
Tom seems to like teach@@ ing French .
C@@ ul@@ tu@@ res of the E@@ a@@ st and the W@@ est are mi@@ x@@ ed in this country .
Tom pu@@ l@@ led out his i@@ P@@ h@@ one .
he thin@@ ks that he can pro@@ ve it .
Tom lo@@ ves cho@@ col@@ ate ca@@ ke .
b@@ as@@ e@@ b@@ all is differ@@ ent from cri@@ ck@@ et .
Tom will do wh@@ at@@ ever it ta@@ kes .
a tea@@ spo@@ on of gr@@ ound c@@ in@@ na@@ m@@ on is about two gra@@ ms .
I am g@@ la@@ d to help you .
I &apos;d like to sp@@ end the whole wee@@ k@@ end sle@@ ep@@ ing .
she got him to do anything she wanted him to do .
you should have a light on .
G@@ o@@ d for@@ b@@ id !
I &apos;ve made a mista@@ ke .
I &apos;m bor@@ ed st@@ i@@ f@@ f .
Tom s@@ col@@ ded Mary .
when was the last time you saw her ?
they wal@@ ked along the road three ab@@ rea@@ st .
to the best of my kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge , the la@@ ke is the de@@ e@@ pe@@ st at this po@@ int .
is it o@@ k@@ ay to use this ?
I did so with a vi@@ e@@ w to plea@@ sing him .
I &apos;m just getting started .
you should &apos;ve in@@ t@@ ro@@ du@@ ced yourself .
please fa@@ st@@ en your se@@ at b@@ el@@ t d@@ ur@@ ing ta@@ k@@ e@@ off and l@@ an@@ ding .
this ex@@ plan@@ ation doesn &apos;t me@@ an anything !
I &apos;m not here for a v@@ ac@@ ation .
the story gave me go@@ os@@ e@@ bu@@ m@@ ps .
we did everything for the w@@ el@@ f@@ are of our children .
it didn &apos;t last more than three minu@@ tes .
Tom is one of Mary &apos;s bro@@ thers .
Tom is going to th@@ ank me .
no other c@@ as@@ u@@ al@@ ti@@ es have been re@@ por@@ ted .
I need a new b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle .
Tom and Mary each took a si@@ p of w@@ ine .
we have to think about this a little lon@@ ger .
Tom w@@ ro@@ te a letter to S@@ an@@ t@@ a .
she married him last year .
Tom left home at 2 : 3@@ 0 .
the ju@@ d@@ ge said he had never seen such an am@@ ic@@ able and mu@@ tu@@ ally ag@@ re@@ ed di@@ v@@ or@@ ce .
she sel@@ ec@@ ted a h@@ at to mat@@ ch her new dress .
what was your mo@@ ti@@ ve ?
we or@@ der@@ ed too much food .
your co@@ at is very beautiful .
I can &apos;t see anything in here .
Tom tre@@ at@@ s me like a p@@ rin@@ c@@ ess .
the English le@@ s@@ son started at 8 : 3@@ 0 .
Tom is a friend .
I did not be@@ tr@@ ay you .
you should know that .
I knew you &apos;d like it .
what happened be@@ tw@@ e@@ en you and Tom ?
Tom &apos;s s@@ ou@@ p ta@@ sted sur@@ pri@@ sin@@ g@@ ly good .
is there something you want to tell me ?
everybody seems to like her .
what are you wr@@ iting ?
we spo@@ ke about an ar@@ ti@@ cle that I had pu@@ b@@ li@@ sh@@ ed .
he has got as many as fi@@ f@@ ty no@@ vel@@ s wr@@ it@@ ten in English .
Tom turned red .
don &apos;t s@@ et f@@ oo@@ t in that ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood .
I had something else in mind .
Tom and Mary bought a h@@ and@@ made ru@@ g .
who tal@@ ked ?
how do you like my new su@@ it ?
he speaks only English and German , ne@@ i@@ ther of which I understand .
would you be so kind as to l@@ end me your book ?
it was so n@@ ice to me@@ et you .
a t@@ oo@@ th can be re@@ pl@@ ac@@ ed with an im@@ pl@@ ant .
she lives in an ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment alone .
this can &apos;t be a rea@@ l di@@ a@@ mon@@ d .
his ex@@ plan@@ ation doesn &apos;t make sen@@ se at all .
the shi@@ p is un@@ sel@@ l@@ able .
Tom is in a good m@@ ood .
I cannot go down the sta@@ ir@@ s . both my le@@ gs are bro@@ ken .
Tom bo@@ il@@ ed the p@@ ot@@ at@@ o@@ es .
Tom sta@@ yed up late into the night wor@@ king on his sp@@ ee@@ ch .
Tom isn &apos;t able to do his job any@@ more .
clo@@ th@@ es make the man .
Tom wasn &apos;t exp@@ ec@@ ting vis@@ it@@ or@@ s .
ear@@ th is per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly su@@ ited for life .
why were you late ?
this la@@ w@@ y@@ er has never lost a ca@@ se .
I would never l@@ end Tom any money .
Tom , what &apos;s wrong with you t@@ on@@ ight ?
a@@ i@@ m . fir@@ e !
I wasn &apos;t exp@@ ec@@ ting you so soon .
Tom met Mary at a party .
and then he s@@ at down himself .
do you have any idea how many people are coming to t@@ on@@ ight &apos;s party ?
by a@@ ir ma@@ il , please .
the picture on the w@@ all was pa@@ in@@ ted by P@@ ic@@ as@@ so .
I was a f@@ ool . I &apos;m sor@@ ry .
I never look at this picture without thin@@ king of those happy days .
I usu@@ ally eat out .
he has enough w@@ il@@ l@@ po@@ wer .
which on@@ l@@ ine dic@@ ti@@ on@@ ary do you use most ?
we ex@@ chang@@ ed gre@@ et@@ in@@ gs .
let us turn now to the f@@ un@@ da@@ m@@ en@@ ta@@ l is@@ su@@ e .
I think Tom &apos;s gr@@ and@@ mother is too old to w@@ ear a min@@ is@@ k@@ ir@@ t .
Tom bu@@ il@@ t a bir@@ d@@ house .
you should eat this while it &apos;s still w@@ ar@@ m .
the door was lo@@ c@@ ked on the in@@ side .
Tom and I are about the same h@@ e@@ ight .
col@@ le@@ ge gra@@ du@@ at@@ es ear@@ n on a@@ ver@@ age over fi@@ f@@ ty p@@ er cent more than those with only a hi@@ gh @-@ school de@@ g@@ ree .
the ra@@ di@@ o is too l@@ ou@@ d .
she is no or@@ din@@ ary stu@@ dent .
please cor@@ rec@@ t my mista@@ kes .
this is a to@@ wer .
have you ever heard of something si@@ mil@@ a@@ r ?
Tom isn &apos;t anything like his brother .
I don &apos;t think I s@@ n@@ ore .
it &apos;s si@@ x o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck already .
I w@@ ro@@ te my the@@ s@@ is about that .
I &apos;ll do my best to get it for you , but I don &apos;t pro@@ mi@@ se anything .
the beg@@ in@@ ning of the tr@@ ou@@ ble was his car@@ el@@ ess re@@ mar@@ k .
some@@ body &apos;s kno@@ c@@ king at your door .
I love to see you s@@ mil@@ e .
I wouldn &apos;t re@@ comm@@ end it .
Tom looked at me like I was c@@ raz@@ y .
you &apos;d better get up early .
take a bu@@ s .
my Ch@@ in@@ ese isn &apos;t very good .
they want to learn English .
you &apos;re a problem .
she can ask quest@@ i@@ ons and answer them .
we a@@ i@@ m at that ob@@ j@@ ec@@ ti@@ ve .
you &apos;ve ear@@ ned it .
my gr@@ and@@ father turned 8@@ 9 years old .
she married her hi@@ gh school s@@ wee@@ the@@ ar@@ t .
can you make an exc@@ ep@@ tion ?
there was no one at all in the whole house .
we have three a@@ ir@@ plan@@ es .
what are you doing down there ?
you could &apos;ve wal@@ ked away .
I &apos;ll be here all morning if anyone nee@@ ds me .
f@@ our per@@ cent in@@ f@@ l@@ ation is fore@@ ca@@ st for this year .
this st@@ at@@ u@@ e was car@@ ved from a sin@@ g@@ le b@@ lo@@ ck of mar@@ ble .
Tom looks dea@@ d .
S@@ am@@ i gi@@ g@@ g@@ led .
this s@@ ci@@ ence @-@ f@@ ic@@ tion no@@ v@@ el is very interest@@ ing .
he con@@ si@@ d@@ ers himself a gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an of mor@@ al st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds .
why do you feel that way ?
K@@ o@@ be is the c@@ ity which I was bor@@ n in .
Tom never wo@@ ke up .
Tom said that Mary was w@@ il@@ ling to help us do that .
I st@@ ep@@ ped on a pi@@ e@@ ce of bro@@ ken gl@@ ass .
Tom said that he wanted to mo@@ ve to Boston .
for once in your life , you &apos;re ex@@ ac@@ tly right .
she likes these cat@@ s .
if I &apos;m sel@@ ling to you , I speak your language . if I &apos;m bu@@ ying , then you have to speak German .
I just lost at the r@@ ac@@ es so I &apos;m f@@ l@@ at broke .
there is no li@@ m@@ it to hu@@ man pro@@ gre@@ ss .
where is the y@@ el@@ low ju@@ g of mil@@ k ?
she &apos;s your da@@ ugh@@ ter , too .
Tom can b@@ end spo@@ ons with the po@@ wer of his mind .
Tom knows what &apos;s best for us .
how is it in a pri@@ v@@ ate school ?
put the gar@@ b@@ age ou@@ t@@ side .
I can &apos;t live without a T@@ V .
you should have pre@@ par@@ ed for the le@@ s@@ son .
she was ab@@ s@@ ent on the gr@@ ound of il@@ l@@ ne@@ ss .
the water in this v@@ il@@ l@@ age is con@@ ta@@ min@@ ated by ar@@ sen@@ ic .
that is no good .
he lost everything he o@@ w@@ ned .
they all con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ated him .
I for@@ got to at@@ ta@@ ch a sta@@ m@@ p to the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e .
come on . let &apos;s get out of here .
we are wor@@ king to fi@@ x this bu@@ g .
eat this up .
you can &apos;t always make everyone happy .
Tom k@@ ept fo@@ cu@@ sed .
a co@@ ke , please .
everyone was s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed .
can you come at n@@ ine ?
I wish you &apos;d never told me .
Tom was k@@ illed with a s@@ word .
Tom was too exc@@ ited to sleep .
Tom is a vi@@ de@@ o ga@@ me de@@ vel@@ op@@ er .
she c@@ ac@@ k@@ led at the p@@ oor man . &quot; so it is that you have one wish left . &quot;
are you here on ho@@ li@@ day ?
Tom isn &apos;t as t@@ all as his father yet .
the wh@@ al@@ e is a ma@@ m@@ ma@@ l .
it &apos;s been a long time since we &apos;ve had such n@@ ice wea@@ ther .
what go@@ es on in this room ?
n@@ one of the me@@ at was f@@ it to eat .
Tom and Mary said John wasn &apos;t at home when they went to vis@@ it him .
if these mu@@ s@@ cl@@ es are wea@@ k , they cannot ho@@ ld the k@@ nee@@ ca@@ p in the cor@@ rec@@ t pos@@ it@@ ion .
when Tom is at home , he doesn &apos;t want to talk about work .
I thought you might &apos;ve left to@@ wn .
I &apos;ll be@@ t Tom will know what to do .
they &apos;ll stop at nothing to a@@ chi@@ e@@ ve their po@@ li@@ ti@@ cal go@@ als .
the ea@@ g@@ le does not cat@@ ch f@@ li@@ es .
Tom already in@@ t@@ ends to leave early .
why don &apos;t you give it an@@ other try ?
how long do you want to stay here ?
it doesn &apos;t matter at all to me .
Tom must be ne@@ ar@@ ly thir@@ ty .
let &apos;s walk to the boo@@ k@@ st@@ ore .
&quot; isn &apos;t it about time you tried p@@ ho@@ to@@ gr@@ ap@@ h@@ ing people or something ? &quot; &quot; E@@ h ? S@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ ts ? I don &apos;t know .@@ .@@ . &quot;
well , we &apos;re ne@@ i@@ gh@@ b@@ our@@ s . I &apos;ll be po@@ p@@ ping over all the time .
they are p@@ ea@@ ce @-@ lo@@ ving people .
here &apos;s what we want .
what &apos;s it wor@@ th to you ?
that &apos;s a problem .
I &apos;m just going to answer the call of n@@ at@@ ure .
he ought to have arrived in N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k about this time .
Tom likes S@@ w@@ is@@ s ch@@ ee@@ se .
a di@@ ag@@ on@@ al mat@@ ri@@ x is pos@@ it@@ i@@ ve se@@ mi@@ de@@ fin@@ ite if and only if all of its el@@ em@@ ents are n@@ on@@ ne@@ g@@ ati@@ ve .
how bad was Tom hur@@ t ?
A@@ p@@ p@@ li@@ can@@ ts must be un@@ der thir@@ ty years old .
I ho@@ pe he will come .
not ha@@ ving rec@@ ei@@ ved a re@@ pl@@ y , he w@@ ro@@ te to her again .
how did you me@@ et your hu@@ s@@ b@@ and ?
even gi@@ ven what you say , I still think you are to b@@ la@@ me .
Tom was here just a mo@@ ment ag@@ o .
he was in a m@@ ood of de@@ pres@@ sion .
how &apos;s your mother , Tom ?
have you already br@@ ought the car@@ t@@ ons up to the at@@ ti@@ c ?
he asked me to do it .
do you like ea@@ ting f@@ ish ?
he pic@@ ked up the phone .
&quot; where are my gl@@ as@@ ses ? &quot; &quot; where you left them . &quot;
we need f@@ l@@ our , su@@ ga@@ r and e@@ g@@ gs to make this ca@@ ke .
you cannot be too car@@ e@@ ful dri@@ ving a car .
the meeting en@@ ded ear@@ li@@ er than usu@@ al .
I have to t@@ each Mary English .
you &apos;ll be O@@ K .
the t@@ y@@ pi@@ cal Japanese person doesn &apos;t speak English .
he is without d@@ ou@@ b@@ t the most su@@ cc@@ es@@ s@@ ful mo@@ vi@@ e di@@ rec@@ tor in the world .
don &apos;t listen to her .
would you and your friends like to play b@@ as@@ k@@ et@@ b@@ all with us ?
what do you do in the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on ?
come over here and help me .
her sp@@ ee@@ ch mo@@ ved the a@@ u@@ di@@ ence .
have you fin@@ ished your sh@@ are of the work ?
Mary told Tom that she thought John was u@@ ne@@ m@@ pl@@ o@@ yed .
s@@ how me a f@@ ac@@ t which sup@@ por@@ ts your idea .
she was very per@@ su@@ as@@ i@@ ve .
I didn &apos;t like be@@ er at that time .
please don &apos;t s@@ mo@@ ke .
Tom com@@ es here every day .
my na@@ il has bro@@ ken .
he &apos;s really sel@@ f@@ ish .
I &apos;ve been in Boston since O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er .
in@@ st@@ ea@@ d of waiting for Tom to come up and speak to you , you should just go up to him .
what is it now , Tom ?
has any@@ body spo@@ ken to Tom ?
they bu@@ il@@ t up tw@@ en@@ ty @-@ fi@@ ve stor@@ ies on one side and thir@@ ty @-@ fi@@ ve stor@@ ies on the other .
&quot; where &apos;s Tom ? &quot; &quot; he didn &apos;t make it . &quot;
A@@ par@@ t from a few min@@ or mista@@ kes , your com@@ pos@@ it@@ ion was exc@@ el@@ l@@ ent .
they are bro@@ thers .
you &apos;ve come too early .
we took par@@ t in the as@@ se@@ mb@@ ly .

people are star@@ ting to st@@ are .
I may go swi@@ mm@@ ing today .
I have a wh@@ ite c@@ at .
Tom &apos;s very , very good .
I met Y@@ o@@ k@@ o on my way to the th@@ ea@@ ter .
I put c@@ rea@@ m in my coffee .
I have to go to the po@@ lice station .
have Tom and Mary already been here ?
why do you try to ru@@ n away ?
you w@@ er@@ en &apos;t wrong .
my so@@ le idea was to get there as fast as possible .
the tru@@ th com@@ es to light .
is this rea@@ l ?
L@@ i@@ ons are str@@ on@@ ger than w@@ ol@@ ves .
I wish my drea@@ m would come true .
I can &apos;t ig@@ n@@ ore that .
he won the first pri@@ ze at the ch@@ ess t@@ our@@ na@@ ment .
I could write Tom a no@@ te if you want me to .
Tom is di@@ eting .
many s@@ ci@@ enti@@ st@@ s knew him .
you must not re@@ ly too much on app@@ ear@@ ance .
give her some f@@ low@@ ers in re@@ turn for her k@@ in@@ d@@ ne@@ ss .
I &apos;ll get my k@@ e@@ ys .
he has more boo@@ ks than I do .
this fi@@ g@@ ure is sup@@ pos@@ ed to re@@ pres@@ ent M@@ ar@@ il@@ y@@ n M@@ on@@ ro@@ e , but I don &apos;t think it does her ju@@ st@@ ice .
it &apos;s very im@@ port@@ ant to resp@@ ect the ru@@ les .
ra@@ i@@ se your h@@ and if you want to speak .
he &apos;s getting up early .
we &apos;ve made a fin@@ al de@@ c@@ is@@ ion .
I just started reading this book .
she looked me in the ey@@ e .

do you know wh@@ ose car this is ?
I have never been so hu@@ mi@@ li@@ ated in my enti@@ re life .
my father has li@@ ved in N@@ ag@@ o@@ y@@ a for more than fi@@ f@@ te@@ en years .
I don &apos;t really ag@@ ree with that .
Mary &apos;s father was a sa@@ il@@ or who never came back .
it ta@@ kes two years for the bu@@ t@@ ter@@ f@@ ly to mat@@ ure .
don &apos;t re@@ ly too much on o@@ thers .
it wor@@ ks on my ma@@ ch@@ ine .
you need to w@@ ear th@@ ic@@ k so@@ c@@ ks to keep your fe@@ et w@@ ar@@ m .
I know something really fu@@ n we can do tomorrow .
is this your money ?
Tom no@@ ti@@ ced that Mary was as@@ le@@ ep .
does he understand what he &apos;s sa@@ ying ?
the car is r@@ un@@ ning fast .
children like to ex@@ pl@@ ore . this can be d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous .
Tom was as na@@ ked as a j@@ a@@ y@@ bir@@ d .

S@@ ei@@ ze the day .

Tom didn &apos;t want it .
just out of cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity , did you really have to do that ?
this en@@ g@@ ine con@@ su@@ mes the most o@@ il .

Tom jo@@ ined the dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sion .

what kee@@ ps you up at night ?
does your wife know ?
I ho@@ pe this d@@ at@@ a will be u@@ se@@ ful to you .
would you ra@@ ther be bl@@ ind or be dea@@ f ?
I cannot p@@ ass the matter by without ma@@ king a pro@@ te@@ st .
I believe that everything happ@@ en@@ s for a reason .
I didn &apos;t k@@ ill any@@ body .
your ex@@ a@@ min@@ ation re@@ su@@ l@@ ts are exc@@ el@@ l@@ ent .
Tom ru@@ sh@@ ed into his off@@ ice and s@@ la@@ m@@ med the door .
I &apos;m here to learn French .

Tom would have been very p@@ r@@ ou@@ d of you .
J@@ i@@ m likes the do@@ c@@ tor .

I think it &apos;s time for me to buy a de@@ cent ca@@ mer@@ a .
par@@ k S@@ tre@@ et nee@@ ds to be re@@ pa@@ ved .
I &apos;m sor@@ ry , but I didn &apos;t know it was a se@@ cre@@ t .

no matter the age , a child is a child .
I haven &apos;t ea@@ ten anything for the pa@@ st three days .

Y@@ am@@ as@@ h@@ it@@ a is stu@@ ck with no way out . his well @-@ thought @-@ out pro@@ j@@ ect was re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted and the boo@@ ks he wor@@ ked really hard on aren &apos;t sel@@ ling .
do you want to see Tom again ?
Tom said he wasn &apos;t interest@@ ed in Mary , but he seem@@ ed to always be looking to@@ w@@ ar@@ ds the side of the room where she was .
I think Tom is j@@ eal@@ ous .
I can &apos;t believe that a gu@@ y like Tom was married to a woman as beautiful as Mary .
Tom reme@@ mb@@ ered everything .
he &apos;s not pa@@ ying any at@@ ten@@ tion to me .
are you here today for any par@@ ti@@ cu@@ la@@ r reason ?
it &apos;s ob@@ vi@@ ous that you &apos;re wrong .
don &apos;t call Tom that .
Tom has his hear@@ t in the right place .
how many cu@@ ps of coffee do you drink a day ?
that is all that he said .
I will go at 1@@ 0 .
please keep qu@@ i@@ et , so you don &apos;t wa@@ ke the b@@ ab@@ y up .

Tom just can &apos;t get along with Mary .
&quot; you don &apos;t mind , do you ? &quot; &quot; of c@@ our@@ se I don &apos;t . &quot;
I &apos;d like to know what you in@@ t@@ end to do now .

P@@ e@@ ter has been tr@@ ying to find a new ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment for some time .
Tom has told us a lot about you .
I am not your en@@ e@@ my .

it was diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t for him to hi@@ de his pri@@ de in his su@@ cc@@ ess .
tell Tom that I &apos;m swi@@ mm@@ ing .
I &apos;m lear@@ ning M@@ a@@ or@@ i .
I ha@@ te m@@ os@@ qu@@ it@@ o@@ es .

A@@ n@@ n often pla@@ ys ten@@ n@@ is after school .

I wanted to sp@@ end more time with Tom .
s@@ end me a pos@@ t@@ car@@ d !
where have you been , Tom ?
some@@ times it can &apos;t be a@@ vo@@ i@@ ded .
we &apos;ve deci@@ ded not to buy that house .
my a@@ un@@ t made me a new s@@ k@@ ir@@ t .
I live in a country where the c@@ ost of a li@@ ter of g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine is ch@@ e@@ aper than the c@@ ost of a li@@ ter of water .
all the b@@ ank ro@@ b@@ b@@ ers were w@@ ear@@ ing m@@ as@@ ks .
I think there &apos;s a mista@@ ke in my b@@ ill .
Mary , come qu@@ ic@@ k ! a f@@ l@@ ying sa@@ u@@ c@@ er has just l@@ an@@ ded in our gar@@ d@@ en .
that re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant &apos;s too exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve .

we should vis@@ it Boston again .
today is a ho@@ li@@ day .
I ho@@ ld this as self @-@ e@@ vi@@ dent .

I lear@@ ned how to do that just last mon@@ th .
do you have a friend na@@ med Tom ?
anything new ?
I had my p@@ ur@@ se st@@ ol@@ en in the bu@@ s .
there &apos;s a mo@@ at around the ca@@ st@@ le .
you don &apos;t need to have such a si@@ m@@ ple con@@ ver@@ s@@ ation in English . you both lear@@ ned each other &apos;s langu@@ ag@@ es in school , didn &apos;t you ?
I knew him .
then , what do you need the money for ?
why do you have so many cat@@ s ?
are you going to do your ho@@ me@@ work this af@@ ter@@ no@@ on ?
the only girl who ever really li@@ ked Tom was Mary .
I don &apos;t know why , but I &apos;m sure that Tom has his reas@@ ons for not hi@@ r@@ ing Mary .
he knows how to gr@@ ill f@@ ish .
I never go any@@ where .
which one do you pre@@ f@@ er ?
our proble@@ ms are nothing com@@ par@@ ed to h@@ ers .

do you see that ?
I p@@ ur@@ c@@ ha@@ sed one .
aren &apos;t you ho@@ t ?
Tom is more ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ ced than me .
fri@@ en@@ d@@ shi@@ p and happ@@ in@@ ess cannot be se@@ par@@ ated .
she is an ou@@ t@@ stan@@ ding po@@ et .
I &apos;d like to stu@@ dy in P@@ ar@@ is .

Tom ju@@ m@@ ped ac@@ r@@ os@@ s the mu@@ d pu@@ dd@@ le .

Tom called the stud@@ ents back into the room to tell them about the plan@@ e cr@@ as@@ h .
I told you never to call me here .
dri@@ ving in R@@ o@@ me is not re@@ comm@@ en@@ ded .
I come from Eng@@ land .
give me back my r@@ ing .
I didn &apos;t know Tom and Mary didn &apos;t have dri@@ ver &apos;s li@@ cen@@ ses .
the wi@@ z@@ ard is back .
Tom and Mary wal@@ ked down the sta@@ ir@@ s together .
you and I don &apos;t see ey@@ e @-@ to @-@ ey@@ e .
she has a little bl@@ ack dog .
I don &apos;t feel like it .
where on ear@@ th do you think Tom is going at this time of night ?
I &apos;m very plea@@ sed to me@@ et you .
who re@@ mo@@ ved it ?
where is my di@@ ary ?
we haven &apos;t seen anyone .
get away from here !
Mary s@@ mil@@ ed for the ca@@ mer@@ a .
I knew that already .
that could happ@@ en to anyone .
Tom didn &apos;t des@@ er@@ ve that .
be car@@ e@@ ful .
Tom is a true ar@@ ti@@ st .
let &apos;s not bo@@ ther Tom .
that &apos;s not sa@@ ying a lot .
C@@ o@@ m@@ pe@@ t@@ ent people need not ap@@ pl@@ y .
he is always it@@ ch@@ ing for a f@@ ight .
I often pla@@ yed b@@ as@@ e@@ b@@ all when I was young .
I for@@ got to tell you what Tom said .
Tom has dis@@ app@@ ear@@ ed .
Tom said he didn &apos;t want to be seen with Mary .
he li@@ ved in K@@ o@@ be for three years .
that &apos;s the sp@@ ir@@ it .
the st@@ ore was re@@ l@@ ati@@ v@@ ely em@@ p@@ ty .
Tom hel@@ ped her to her fe@@ et .
Tom wants you dea@@ d .
the po@@ lice still have no lea@@ ds .
he can &apos;t speak English , can he ?
Tom was un@@ married .
are you sure you don &apos;t want to wa@@ it for Tom ?
s@@ how me how to do it .
he is a b@@ re@@ wer of be@@ er by tra@@ de .
Tom was in the ar@@ my .
there must be some mis@@ under@@ stan@@ ding .
she kis@@ sed him on both ch@@ ee@@ ks .
they told him : &quot; tomorrow you are to be h@@ ang@@ ed . &quot; H@@ ear@@ ing that did not ex@@ ac@@ tly ch@@ e@@ er him .
she &apos;s a lot ol@@ der than he is .
I think that you &apos;re the one that I &apos;ve been waiting for for all these years .
I didn &apos;t believe a word my gr@@ and@@ father said .
I@@ tal@@ i@@ an tel@@ e@@ vis@@ ion is u@@ sel@@ ess .
how long have you been in love with her ?
the problem is we don &apos;t have enough money .
I &apos;m fe@@ el@@ ing a little b@@ lu@@ e today .
Mary wants her mother &apos;s ap@@ pro@@ v@@ al .
Tom asked to be cor@@ rec@@ ted .
I &apos;d like to have a gl@@ ass of w@@ ine .
you were Tom &apos;s ac@@ comp@@ lice , w@@ er@@ en &apos;t you ?
he told me that he had lost his watch .
even if they have a good w@@ ine m@@ en@@ u , I will not want to d@@ ine here .
I &apos;ll try , but I don &apos;t know for sure wh@@ e@@ ther I &apos;ll be able to go to the c@@ in@@ em@@ a tomorrow or not .
you &apos;d better really love her ; people are un@@ chang@@ ea@@ ble .
we &apos;ve said our g@@ oo@@ d@@ b@@ y@@ es .
the re@@ qu@@ est qu@@ e@@ u@@ e was fu@@ ll .
you can &apos;t dri@@ ve .
are you plan@@ ning to help Tom ?
Mary is a po@@ pu@@ la@@ r ac@@ tre@@ ss .
what &apos;s your im@@ pres@@ sion of Tom ?
I love pla@@ ying C@@ ho@@ p@@ in .
this car r@@ un@@ s on n@@ at@@ ur@@ al g@@ as .
did I f@@ all as@@ le@@ ep ?
she got bor@@ ed qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
the c@@ at is un@@ der the bed .
the min@@ i@@ ster was ob@@ li@@ g@@ ed to re@@ si@@ g@@ n from the C@@ ab@@ in@@ et .
I w@@ ei@@ gh 1@@ 3@@ 0 p@@ oun@@ ds .
I know his brother well .
he d@@ w@@ el@@ t on the compl@@ ex@@ it@@ ies of mo@@ der@@ n life .
Tom was a rea@@ l h@@ er@@ o .
many people were k@@ illed in the plan@@ e ac@@ cident .
I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s not going to be that easy .
it &apos;ll soon be d@@ ar@@ k .
I only have a week to get this done .
you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t talk about people be@@ h@@ ind their b@@ ac@@ ks .
the s@@ qu@@ ir@@ re@@ l ate out of his h@@ and .
he didn &apos;t eat anything yesterday .
did you take one of the c@@ oo@@ ki@@ es while I was not looking ? I ba@@ ked 2@@ 0 c@@ oo@@ ki@@ es , not 1@@ 9 .
my name is Tom , too .
I &apos;ll take my father &apos;s place .
the two children were of an age .
do you get the im@@ pres@@ sion that all of our po@@ li@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans are too old ?
bu@@ sin@@ ess people ex@@ change car@@ ds at the beg@@ in@@ ning or end of a meeting .
the red b@@ el@@ t ma@@ kes her bl@@ ack dress look even better .
would you mind if I ask you a per@@ s@@ on@@ al question ?
I don &apos;t want to believe that .
can &apos;t you hear the s@@ ound ?
you don &apos;t look like your da@@ d .
life is a great mis@@ er@@ y .
Tom came to pic@@ k me up .
I am g@@ la@@ d to hear the ne@@ ws .
he sta@@ yed up late .
C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ ans are our friends .
my little to@@ e hur@@ ts .
I fin@@ ally found out what had been ca@@ u@@ sing the p@@ ain in my le@@ g .
A@@ st@@ er@@ o@@ i@@ ds are not cl@@ ose to each other . they are r@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly 1 mil@@ li@@ on mil@@ es from each other .
you have to ac@@ cu@@ st@@ om yourself to the c@@ row@@ ded tra@@ ins in T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o .
the ju@@ d@@ ge con@@ de@@ m@@ ned him to death .
she &apos;s not ig@@ n@@ or@@ ing me ; she &apos;s sh@@ y .
as soon as he heard of it , he ha@@ st@@ ened to the spo@@ t .
Tom re@@ turned from the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en with two mu@@ gs of coffee and s@@ at down next to Mary .
my mother is out .
which f@@ il@@ m did you see ?
I &apos;ve never tru@@ sted Tom .
b@@ ill w@@ ro@@ te the letter .
please help me .
Tom for@@ got to fe@@ ed the dog .
Tom is a f@@ ool .
they tal@@ ked about po@@ li@@ ti@@ c@@ s .
I &apos;ve said I &apos;m sor@@ ry .

U@@ to@@ pi@@ a today me@@ ans a re@@ al@@ is@@ able im@@ pos@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ty .
what &apos;s st@@ op@@ ping us ?
Tom doesn &apos;t se@@ em to like doing that .
I &apos;ll watch T@@ V .
Tom and Mary told John that they were busy .
if I knew what the picture was going to be like I wouldn &apos;t make it . it was almost like it was made already . the ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge is more about tr@@ ying to make what you can &apos;t think of .
I have a big fav@@ or to ask .
the house nee@@ ds a new co@@ at of pa@@ int .
I was happy for them .
Tom got tired soon .
Tom is ac@@ cu@@ sto@@ med to win@@ ning .
that &apos;s not what she was talking about .
H@@ y@@ d@@ r@@ ation is cr@@ it@@ ic@@ ally im@@ port@@ ant in ho@@ t wea@@ ther .
O@@ K , I &apos;ll or@@ der it .
my m@@ om told me that I was f@@ at .
I am a man who can &apos;t stand being alone .
do you think Tom likes Mary ?
love happ@@ en@@ s when you lea@@ st exp@@ ect it .
you &apos;d better con@@ su@@ l@@ t the do@@ c@@ tor .
that &apos;s ex@@ ac@@ tly what he wanted .
th@@ an@@ ks so much for coming !
she has some li@@ ter@@ ary tal@@ ent .
pri@@ ces went to a@@ ma@@ z@@ in@@ g@@ ly low le@@ vel@@ s .
I &apos;m not as op@@ ti@@ mi@@ st@@ ic as Tom is .
in a c@@ ru@@ el@@ ly ir@@ on@@ ic t@@ wi@@ st of f@@ ate , some@@ day T@@ at@@ o@@ e@@ b@@ a will make an ex@@ am@@ ple of us all .
where did you come from ?
they hel@@ ped him get to C@@ an@@ ad@@ a .
Tom says you can fi@@ x anything .
the p@@ oor young man fin@@ ally be@@ came a great ar@@ ti@@ st .
you &apos;ve seen what Tom can do .
Tom has a wife and three da@@ ugh@@ t@@ ers .
Tom ta@@ ught Mary how to play the pi@@ an@@ o .
do you think that Tom will be early ?
I believe in him .
Tom and Mary look like they &apos;re bor@@ ed .
Tom did not make friends as ea@@ s@@ il@@ y as Mary .
I should &apos;ve just gi@@ ven Tom what he wanted .
car pro@@ du@@ c@@ tion in that year rea@@ ch@@ ed a rec@@ or@@ d 1@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on v@@ e@@ hi@@ cl@@ es .
Tom car@@ ed for his si@@ ck father .
I gave my v@@ ot@@ e to K@@ en .
Tom al@@ so speaks French .
what do you want to ask me ?
they don &apos;t listen .
we can &apos;t do this any@@ more .
those are Tom &apos;s .
my new A@@ l@@ f@@ a R@@ o@@ me@@ o con@@ ver@@ ti@@ ble is light red .
tell her I &apos;m in the off@@ ice .
the in@@ f@@ ant has been ex@@ pos@@ ed to ra@@ di@@ o@@ ac@@ ti@@ ve ra@@ ys .
put away such a f@@ oo@@ lish idea .
table s@@ al@@ t is com@@ pos@@ ed of so@@ di@@ u@@ m and ch@@ l@@ or@@ ine at@@ o@@ ms .
e@@ du@@ c@@ ation should not be a b@@ ur@@ d@@ en on the parents as well as on the children .
was that you in the car ?
they couldn &apos;t stop s@@ mil@@ ing .
do you know who those people are ?
I am afraid he will make a mista@@ ke .
you must hur@@ ry up .
why can &apos;t you go now ?
it would be better for you not to ask him for ad@@ vi@@ ce .
you and Tom have a lot in comm@@ on .
my name is Tom and I &apos;m an al@@ co@@ ho@@ li@@ c .
I want you to me@@ et my c@@ ous@@ in .
I don &apos;t want to be the one to tell Tom that .
she lear@@ ned L@@ at@@ in in school .
I have to do it again .
the v@@ il@@ l@@ age was i@@ sol@@ ated by the f@@ l@@ ood .
the room was f@@ illed with people .
all the e@@ ff@@ or@@ ts went down the d@@ rain .
the mother used her own mil@@ k to n@@ ou@@ ri@@ sh the b@@ ab@@ y .
I would have done anything in the world to help him .
per@@ h@@ ap@@ s I am mista@@ ken .
K@@ o@@ al@@ as are c@@ ool .

we should try to understand each other .
s@@ how me how to do it , please .

the D@@ u@@ ke r@@ ose and kis@@ sed his wife lo@@ v@@ in@@ g@@ ly .
the s@@ ou@@ p &apos;s too ho@@ t , I can &apos;t eat it .
she &apos;s never f@@ al@@ l@@ en in love .
are you in fav@@ or of this mo@@ tion ?
everything should be done in ac@@ cor@@ d@@ ance with the ru@@ les .
take your sho@@ es off .
Tom &apos;s first week on the job didn &apos;t go very well .
don &apos;t you have any s@@ ha@@ me at all ?
what made you su@@ sp@@ ic@@ i@@ ous ?
listen to me car@@ e@@ fu@@ l@@ ly , and you will understand what I really me@@ an .
I can &apos;t go with you .
do you know the W@@ i@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a we@@ b@@ s@@ ite ?
he ea@@ ts n@@ on @-@ stop .
if you wish to speak to Tom , you &apos;ll need to wa@@ it about three hours .
how many ma@@ ga@@ z@@ in@@ es are on the des@@ k ?
my big sister was@@ h@@ es her hair every morning .
it isn &apos;t easy .
he &apos;s always jo@@ king .
he has had a c@@ ru@@ sh on her .
when be@@ ar@@ s sleep or li@@ e down , their pos@@ tu@@ res de@@ p@@ end on wh@@ e@@ ther they want to get ri@@ d of h@@ eat or con@@ ser@@ ve it .
who ta@@ ught you how to play the pi@@ an@@ o ?

the S@@ p@@ an@@ ish sol@@ di@@ ers used s@@ mo@@ k@@ el@@ ess g@@ un@@ po@@ w@@ der .
Mary said she plan@@ ned on doing that on M@@ on@@ day .
what &apos;s it going to take to per@@ su@@ a@@ de you ?
Tom might be tal@@ l@@ er than you .
I have the same tr@@ ou@@ ble as you have .
these three years have g@@ one by like three days , just like a drea@@ m !
Mary de@@ fi@@ ed her father &apos;s w@@ ish@@ es .
he is gu@@ il@@ ty of the@@ ft .
you made me do it .
I wish you would stop d@@ ou@@ b@@ ting me .
you &apos;ll do ex@@ ac@@ tly as I say .
Tom op@@ ened his re@@ fri@@ g@@ er@@ at@@ or and looked in@@ side .
did you have fu@@ n with Tom ?
Tom fe@@ el@@ s a b@@ it un@@ der the wea@@ ther today .
please tell me where to par@@ k my car .
home pri@@ ces are pl@@ u@@ m@@ me@@ ting .
Tom says he &apos;ll give it a try .
they &apos;re Tom and Mary .
Tom told me that he thought that Mary was un@@ con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous .
I tal@@ ked to Mary today about what she plan@@ s to do .
I don &apos;t have a pen@@ ci@@ l .
we know that you li@@ ed to us the last time we spo@@ ke together .
the man fell down on the gr@@ ound .
it &apos;s n@@ at@@ ur@@ al for him to get ma@@ d .
that &apos;s ex@@ ac@@ tly what I thought .
I was mo@@ ved by his t@@ ears .
I think it &apos;s time for me to sh@@ ar@@ p@@ en my pen@@ ci@@ l .
it was a very exc@@ iting ga@@ me .
come on !
he gave us a de@@ ta@@ il@@ ed ac@@ coun@@ t of his ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ ces in A@@ fri@@ c@@ a .
that must be my book .
any new jo@@ kes ?
nobody asked Tom .
we have to make up for lost time .
we didn &apos;t believe him .
I &apos;ve been re@@ quest@@ ed to help you .
we Japanese come of age at tw@@ en@@ ty .
Tom had to stay in bed .
Tom really doesn &apos;t want to tell Mary where he was .
that &apos;s where Tom lives .
B@@ o@@ b could not con@@ t@@ ro@@ l his ang@@ er .
with@@ in days , Japan c@@ ap@@ tur@@ ed the Amer@@ i@@ can is@@ land of G@@ u@@ am .
I &apos;m good at ma@@ the@@ mat@@ ic@@ s .
don &apos;t let him d@@ ra@@ w you into a the@@ o@@ lo@@ gi@@ cal de@@ b@@ ate , or you &apos;ll be stu@@ ck there all night !
let &apos;s ru@@ n to the bu@@ s stop .
Mary ju@@ m@@ ped into the p@@ ool .
let me be .
there were no ra@@ il@@ ro@@ a@@ ds .
I don &apos;t mind sh@@ ar@@ ing a room with her .
what is your bl@@ ood t@@ y@@ pe ?
Tom will be f@@ l@@ ying back to Boston on M@@ on@@ day .
since the co@@ at Tom tried on was too small , the cl@@ er@@ k gave him an@@ other one to try on .
let me t@@ each you a better way to do that .
can I see it ?
we ag@@ re@@ ed on 2 : 3@@ 0 .
he said hel@@ l@@ o to the woman .
why did you ab@@ an@@ don me ?
this t@@ ask took three hours .
she rea@@ ds .
s@@ qu@@ ir@@ re@@ ls eat se@@ e@@ ds and nu@@ ts , as well as in@@ se@@ c@@ ts and mu@@ sh@@ r@@ oo@@ ms .
what you are tel@@ ling me about L@@ i@@ is@@ a is quite out of ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter .
I wish you su@@ cc@@ ess .
when I was a boy , I was ad@@ dic@@ ted to reading de@@ t@@ ec@@ ti@@ ve stor@@ ies .
Tom ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed the plan .
I was a@@ st@@ on@@ ished at the ne@@ ws .
it took Tom fi@@ f@@ te@@ en minu@@ tes of g@@ oo@@ g@@ ling before he found what he was looking for .

where are your parents ?
Tom asked me to look after his children .
all my du@@ ck@@ l@@ in@@ gs are swi@@ mm@@ ing in the la@@ ke .
I cannot take my children to the mo@@ vi@@ e th@@ ea@@ ter .
nothing much has chang@@ ed .
I do not have a lot of money .

they have as@@ si@@ g@@ ned me a small room .
Tom was sen@@ ten@@ ced to 1@@ 0 years in pri@@ son .
the pos@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ti@@ es are en@@ d@@ less .
I can &apos;t swi@@ m .
are you from U@@ ru@@ m@@ q@@ i ?
I must make up for lost time by dri@@ ving fast .
I was ca@@ ught in a sho@@ wer and was dre@@ n@@ ch@@ ed to the s@@ k@@ in .
the si@@ st@@ ers often qu@@ ar@@ re@@ l over nothing .
it is no use wor@@ r@@ ying about it .
I just can &apos;t o@@ ver@@ look his ru@@ de be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or .
Tom is in@@ to@@ x@@ ic@@ ated .
I have money .
what is the cor@@ rec@@ t ap@@ er@@ ture in this light ?
you will do no such thing .
Tom lives in a H@@ is@@ p@@ an@@ ic ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood .
Tom f@@ led the la@@ w and es@@ c@@ ap@@ ed to B@@ raz@@ il .
he watch@@ ed the S@@ we@@ di@@ sh f@@ il@@ m .
J@@ e@@ w@@ el@@ s wor@@ th € 4@@ 0 @-@ mil@@ li@@ on were st@@ ol@@ en in C@@ an@@ n@@ es from the C@@ ar@@ l@@ ton ho@@ te@@ l .
Tom is going to be very hur@@ t .
Tom has his own room .
that &apos;s an o@@ d@@ d re@@ qu@@ est .
he couldn &apos;t fin@@ ish the ra@@ ce since he had been exp@@ en@@ ding too much en@@ er@@ g@@ y by tr@@ ying to stay with the lea@@ d@@ ers .
he no@@ d@@ ded as much as to say that he ag@@ re@@ ed .
that gu@@ y is to@@ t@@ ally nu@@ ts !
Tom had his w@@ is@@ d@@ om t@@ ee@@ th ta@@ ken out .
they spo@@ ke to each other on the phone .
is it true that you c@@ le@@ an@@ ed the house by yourself ?
he and I are b@@ os@@ om friends .
I don &apos;t want to be ru@@ de .
Tom op@@ ened the door for the dog .
the tu@@ m@@ or is m@@ ali@@ g@@ n@@ ant .
are you sure we can &apos;t re@@ pa@@ ir this ca@@ mer@@ a ?
Tom doesn &apos;t like ch@@ ee@@ se .
are you sure you know what you &apos;re doing ?
don &apos;t f@@ ear the st@@ in@@ g@@ ing of the th@@ or@@ n@@ s if you want to brea@@ k the r@@ ose .
what did you end up doing ?
Tom tried to remember the do@@ c@@ tor &apos;s name , but he couldn &apos;t .
the road of exc@@ ess lea@@ ds to the p@@ al@@ a@@ ce of w@@ is@@ d@@ om .
all comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ation with the ma@@ in@@ land was cu@@ t off by the t@@ y@@ p@@ ho@@ on .
I ag@@ ree to your plan .

when in the b@@ ar@@ n the hea@@ ting fa@@ il@@ s , cu@@ bi@@ c sh@@ ap@@ e the mil@@ k y@@ i@@ el@@ d ta@@ kes .
I wish you &apos;d stop being afraid of me .
I gave Tom all my money .
would you like to have lo@@ ts of money ?
I have a f@@ ever .
where do you think you &apos;re going dre@@ s@@ sed like that ?
you can re@@ ly on her .
I v@@ ot@@ ed for him .
Tom saw his parents ar@@ gu@@ ing .
I had an@@ other drea@@ m . in my drea@@ m , I saw a per@@ f@@ ect dic@@ ti@@ on@@ ary .
I don &apos;t get this .
you should ex@@ er@@ t yourself to get better re@@ su@@ l@@ ts .
you were right and I was wrong .
it &apos;s been tried .
it &apos;s hard to believe .
Tom knew that Mary wasn &apos;t very hun@@ g@@ ry .
Tom re@@ ma@@ ined sin@@ g@@ le all his life .
I &apos;ll leave it to you to buy the ti@@ ck@@ e@@ ts .
I &apos;ve been waiting for you to wa@@ ke up .
a won@@ der@@ ful idea just r@@ an through my mind .
our vi@@ e@@ ws on the matter are in ac@@ cor@@ d .
Tom is ang@@ ry because Mary bor@@ row@@ ed his l@@ ap@@ to@@ p without as@@ king .
M@@ r S@@ m@@ ith lives in K@@ yo@@ to now .
you &apos;d better let me do that for you .
we must con@@ for@@ m to the ru@@ les .
I don &apos;t know when he &apos;ll come again .
there was no way to hi@@ de it .
their op@@ in@@ i@@ ons diff@@ er from m@@ ine .
it is a matter of in@@ differ@@ ence to him .
will you take c@@ are of the children while I &apos;m out ?
I &apos;ve been sa@@ ying that all along .
the h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ al is o@@ ver@@ ru@@ n .
it is d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous to dri@@ ve so fast .
Tom plan@@ s to go to Boston next week .
brea@@ k@@ fast is ready .
what ar@@ e@@ a of Ch@@ in@@ a do you like the best ?
Tom and Mary told John they ha@@ dn &apos;t seen Alice in years .
I can &apos;t believe he left me for that wh@@ ore !
he can be tru@@ sted .
Tom sel@@ d@@ om s@@ no@@ res .
&quot; you have been in A@@ f@@ gh@@ an@@ i@@ st@@ an , I per@@ c@@ ei@@ ve . &quot; &quot; how on ear@@ th did you know that ? &quot; I asked in a@@ st@@ on@@ ish@@ ment .
we left f@@ our days lat@@ er .
this country is p@@ oor in n@@ at@@ ur@@ al re@@ s@@ our@@ ces .
Tom could write his name when he was three years old .
Tom is e@@ mb@@ ar@@ r@@ as@@ sed by his son &apos;s be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or .
didn &apos;t you get a pos@@ t@@ car@@ d from Tom ?
she r@@ an away with the e@@ g@@ gs .
to my dis@@ may , he was ca@@ ught ch@@ ea@@ ting in the ex@@ a@@ min@@ ation .
I &apos;m beg@@ in@@ ning to understand why Tom lo@@ ves Boston .
how could I make him f@@ all for it ?
a fir@@ e broke out on the se@@ con@@ d f@@ loo@@ r of the bu@@ il@@ ding .
we &apos;re not getting married .
listen to me , Tom .
Tom b@@ ar@@ ely speaks English .
we were wor@@ ried si@@ ck about you !
Tom always has a b@@ ac@@ k@@ up plan .
K@@ en mi@@ st@@ ook you for me .
is there an A@@ T@@ M around here ?
I ho@@ pe Tom doesn &apos;t change his mind .
was he home alone ?
I was waiting .
I &apos;m on v@@ ac@@ ation .
if you can &apos;t keep your pro@@ mi@@ se , what ex@@ cu@@ se will you make ?
you have a me@@ s@@ sa@@ ge .
I o@@ we what I am today to e@@ du@@ c@@ ation .
how often do you read boo@@ ks ?
I have cer@@ tain ri@@ gh@@ ts .
she &apos;s too old for me .
I want to say I &apos;m sor@@ ry .
Tom seems to be un@@ w@@ il@@ ling to cor@@ rec@@ t his mista@@ kes .
the col@@ our@@ s of her dress and sho@@ es go well together .
he got re@@ l@@ ated with her through mar@@ ri@@ age .
sh@@ ar@@ p &apos;s the word !
Tom called Mary up from the a@@ ir@@ por@@ t .
she isn &apos;t as young as she looks .
it &apos;s so hea@@ v@@ y that I can &apos;t li@@ ft it .
Mary said she &apos;s been asked not do that again .
we have a f@@ ar@@ m .
do you know how I can get there ?
some@@ times it is im@@ port@@ ant to take a de@@ c@@ is@@ ion qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
I like her . she &apos;s so beautiful !
the meeting en@@ ded ear@@ li@@ er than usu@@ al .
Tom says he &apos;ll never do that again .
we &apos;ll try .
Tom &apos;s married .
Tom , you &apos;ve got to wa@@ ke up .
the f@@ ac@@ t is that he did not no@@ ti@@ ce the differ@@ ence .
you can watch T@@ V after sup@@ p@@ er .
he lo@@ ves her like c@@ raz@@ y .
Tom sho@@ w@@ ed us his mother &apos;s picture .
P@@ a@@ u@@ l didn &apos;t be@@ come ar@@ ro@@ g@@ ant even th@@ ough he was ri@@ ch .
I &apos;ve got a se@@ cre@@ t .
he didn &apos;t at@@ t@@ end the meeting .
I couldn &apos;t have done it without you .
I have to answer this letter right away .
cl@@ ose your ey@@ es and try to remember .
Mary said she was looking for a job in Boston .
her son was k@@ illed in the ac@@ cident .
would you mind d@@ ra@@ w@@ ing down the bl@@ ind ?
say no to r@@ ac@@ is@@ m .
Tom wor@@ ks h@@ ar@@ der than he used to .
Tom &apos;s son was k@@ illed in a tra@@ ff@@ ic ac@@ cident last win@@ ter .
it &apos;s qu@@ ar@@ ter to e@@ ight now .
had she been there before ?
I t@@ each French .
Mary w@@ ished she ha@@ dn &apos;t asked Tom to t@@ each her how to dri@@ ve .
you didn &apos;t see him .
have you ever been in Boston before ?
he had a tra@@ ff@@ ic ac@@ cident on his way to school .
I don &apos;t know what has happened to him .
Tom looked a little ang@@ ry .
in 1@@ 9@@ 4@@ 0 , life was diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t .
du@@ e to in@@ cre@@ as@@ ing an@@ x@@ i@@ e@@ ty , Tom d@@ r@@ ank coffee in the mi@@ dd@@ le of the night which did not help .
his name was Tom .
I understand that .
why don &apos;t you ever want to talk about the pa@@ st ?
he likes ta@@ king wal@@ ks .
will you help us ?
the M@@ i@@ dd@@ le A@@ g@@ es la@@ sted 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 years .
please give me the p@@ aper when you have done with it .
do you have anything sp@@ ec@@ i@@ al in mind ?
Tom tried .

these car@@ s are made in Japan .
Tom likes ma@@ king p@@ aper a@@ er@@ o@@ plan@@ es .
you &apos;re in@@ com@@ pe@@ t@@ ent .
what are you doing , D@@ ad ?
a man who knows two langu@@ ag@@ es is wor@@ th two men .
I &apos;ll give you anything that you want .
Tom and Mary arrived in a h@@ or@@ se @-@ d@@ ra@@ wn car@@ ri@@ age .
M@@ in@@ i @-@ s@@ k@@ ir@@ ts are back in f@@ as@@ hi@@ on again .
that looks like Tom .
Tom and Mary se@@ em to like each other .
we think that &apos;s a good thing .
how did you know Tom would be there ?
he &apos;ll w@@ in for sure .
I don &apos;t want you to have anything to do with Tom .
Tom has no de@@ si@@ re to go to the mo@@ vi@@ es .
I met some@@ body on@@ l@@ ine .
it is said that there will be an el@@ ec@@ tion soon .
I bought her a new car .
tell Tom that I &apos;m doing my ho@@ me@@ work .
open the c@@ ur@@ ta@@ ins and let the s@@ un@@ sh@@ ine in .
you should ap@@ o@@ lo@@ gi@@ ze to Tom for being late .
Tom has told me a lot about you .
do you know us ?
I asked G@@ o@@ d for a bi@@ ke , but I know G@@ o@@ d doesn &apos;t work that way . so I sto@@ le a bi@@ ke and asked for for@@ gi@@ ven@@ ess .
I go on f@@ oo@@ t .
are you still ali@@ ve ?
how about you come with me ?
we have something very im@@ port@@ ant that we have to dis@@ cu@@ ss .
the c@@ ur@@ ren@@ t de@@ b@@ t li@@ m@@ it stan@@ ds at $ 1@@ 5@@ .@@ 2 tr@@ il@@ li@@ on .
I &apos;m going to buy some b@@ read .
did you speak with Tom ?
Tom has a p@@ et s@@ qu@@ ir@@ re@@ l .
you &apos;ll see the b@@ ank on the left h@@ and side of the h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ al .
keep the child away from the p@@ on@@ d .
you &apos;d better ask D@@ r@@ . T@@ an@@ a@@ k@@ a .
the gre@@ en@@ g@@ ro@@ c@@ er is very kind to his cu@@ sto@@ m@@ ers .
have you done this kind of thing before ?
this room is not su@@ it@@ able for sle@@ ep@@ ing .
I &apos;ll call my hu@@ s@@ b@@ and .
you didn &apos;t need to take a ta@@ x@@ i .
my time has not yet come .
I just bought an@@ other s@@ wea@@ ter . now I have 2@@ 1 !
how is it made ?
Mary is tra@@ vel@@ ing by h@@ er@@ self .
his as@@ h@@ es are bu@@ ried here .
I love my da@@ ugh@@ ter .
if you play like that , you &apos;ll be ch@@ ec@@ k@@ mat@@ ed in ten mo@@ ves .
Tom &apos;s parents got di@@ v@@ or@@ ced when he was very young .
you l@@ ose your fu@@ ture when your child di@@ es .
my best friend com@@ es from C@@ an@@ ad@@ a .
he just mo@@ ved into an ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment he in@@ h@@ er@@ ited from his parents .
she has pl@@ at@@ in@@ u@@ m bl@@ on@@ de hair .
we can sa@@ ve a little time if we do what Tom su@@ g@@ g@@ est@@ s .
have you heard this story already ?
her work is al@@ so v@@ al@@ u@@ able .
they had the work fin@@ ished .
we need to talk .
do you remember when you last saw Tom ?
you could never do that .
you &apos;re t@@ em@@ p@@ ting f@@ ate .
there wasn &apos;t anything I could do to help Tom .
she has small brea@@ st@@ s , but I don &apos;t mind .
ne@@ i@@ ther Tom no@@ r Mary has been hel@@ ping us with that .
you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t do his work .
did you get w@@ et ?
I had nothing better to do .
we &apos;re all here exc@@ ept for him .
I was the one who ta@@ ught Tom to read .
it is im@@ port@@ ant to understand that each country has its own cu@@ l@@ ture .
you do have to come along !
ten years have g@@ one by since my father died .
no one ag@@ re@@ ed with me .
a m@@ ine is where you find pre@@ ci@@ ous min@@ er@@ als .
I can swi@@ m as well as you .
I &apos;ll sur@@ pri@@ se them .
the work must be done by Tom .
we can &apos;t f@@ ight here .
can I come to your off@@ ice tomorrow ?
who &apos;s your a@@ un@@ t ?
why do you like us ?
she put on a co@@ at .
I don &apos;t know if today is T@@ u@@ es@@ day or W@@ e@@ d@@ ne@@ s@@ day .
what &apos;s the di@@ ag@@ n@@ os@@ is ?
I &apos;ve c@@ li@@ mb@@ ed M@@ t . F@@ u@@ j@@ i three times .
I &apos;m to b@@ la@@ me , not you .
I fell in love with her im@@ me@@ di@@ at@@ ely .
is it in there ?
he put on an a@@ ir of in@@ no@@ c@@ ence .
she likes to s@@ how off .
Mary at@@ t@@ em@@ p@@ ted to k@@ ill h@@ er@@ self .
do you really want a job in the same off@@ ice as Tom ?
as soon as he went out , it beg@@ an to rain .
Tom app@@ ear@@ ed cal@@ m .
why are you so busy ?
would you please leave ?
she is a r@@ un@@ ner .
we must stop him from doing such stu@@ p@@ id things .
life is a gi@@ ft . ac@@ c@@ ept it .
after se@@ ver@@ al d@@ el@@ a@@ ys , the plan@@ e fin@@ ally left .
it &apos;s very li@@ k@@ ely that it will rain tomorrow .
my un@@ cle k@@ ept on drin@@ king in sp@@ ite of his do@@ c@@ tor &apos;s ad@@ vi@@ ce .
Mary is much f@@ at@@ ter than she used to be .
I &apos;ve never been ro@@ b@@ bed .
Tom d@@ yed his hair bro@@ wn .
su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly he saw me .
my time is exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve because time is the most pre@@ ci@@ ous thing we have . but for lear@@ ning langu@@ ag@@ es , I always have the time . because with each new word we learn , our world be@@ com@@ es a ta@@ d more interest@@ ing .
the at@@ m@@ os@@ p@@ here pro@@ t@@ ec@@ ts us from me@@ te@@ or@@ s .
Tom made a fa@@ u@@ x p@@ as .
I want to go there by my@@ self .
we both want to go to Boston .
I &apos;ve got a few quest@@ i@@ ons for you .
only Mary was n@@ ice to me .
she asked me how many langu@@ ag@@ es I spo@@ ke .
where should I put my su@@ it@@ ca@@ se ?
the pro@@ di@@ g@@ al son re@@ turned home .
&quot; have you ever thought of k@@ il@@ ling yourself ? &quot; &quot; no , I &apos;m not a person who would end their own life . &quot;
there are many beautiful par@@ ks in Boston .
you don &apos;t like me , do you ?
do you think anyone can see me ?
I think Tom should stay .
we heard Tom come do@@ w@@ n@@ sta@@ ir@@ s .
I cannot d@@ ra@@ w a car . it &apos;s too diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t .
his ob@@ j@@ ect is to p@@ ass the te@@ st .
C@@ ol@@ u@@ m@@ bu@@ s dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ed Amer@@ ic@@ a in 1@@ 4@@ 9@@ 2 .
Tom is c@@ le@@ ver and re@@ s@@ our@@ ce@@ ful .
the ga@@ mb@@ l@@ er lost a good dea@@ l of money .
do you think that Tom was the one who did that ?
she is afraid of cat@@ s .
Tom and Mary don &apos;t even know each other .
Tom is vi@@ ol@@ ent and d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous .
Ch@@ in@@ a is per@@ h@@ ap@@ s the only country in the world where the t@@ em@@ per@@ at@@ ure is con@@ t@@ ro@@ l@@ led by the go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment .
he tre@@ ated me b@@ ad@@ ly .
try this on .
why are they doing this to me ?
Tom and I are no lon@@ ger together .
ex@@ cu@@ se me , could you please take a p@@ ho@@ to of my friends and me ?
the de@@ vi@@ l is an op@@ ti@@ mi@@ st if he thin@@ ks he can make people me@@ an@@ er .
I r@@ an ou@@ t@@ side and the door lo@@ c@@ ked it@@ self be@@ h@@ ind me .
I won@@ der how Tom will get out of that me@@ ss .
this is a jo@@ ke , right ?
Tom never chang@@ es .
he ac@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ g@@ ed it to be true .
she died a happy woman .
I don &apos;t want to re@@ gre@@ t lat@@ er in life ha@@ ving mis@@ sed out on something in my you@@ th .
per@@ h@@ ap@@ s I ought to tell Tom what happened .

I am as@@ ha@@ med of my@@ self for my p@@ oor English .
Tom didn &apos;t no@@ ti@@ ce me .
all of the to@@ ys are w@@ oo@@ d@@ en .
Mary is a f@@ ine @-@ looking woman .
why are you looking at me like that ?
he has no wife , no children and no friends .
I &apos;d ra@@ ther walk than wa@@ it for a bu@@ s .
you will have to ap@@ o@@ lo@@ gi@@ ze when you see him .

Tom tal@@ ked with his friends yesterday .
Mary bu@@ ried her face in her han@@ ds and so@@ b@@ bed un@@ con@@ t@@ ro@@ l@@ l@@ ab@@ ly .

Tom took off his h@@ at .
Tom took the s@@ c@@ is@@ sor@@ s away from Mary .
I &apos;m not even sure who he is .
she bought ch@@ ic@@ ken .
we sle@@ p@@ t in a very small t@@ ent .
I really wasn &apos;t exp@@ ec@@ ting that from you .
everything he says is cor@@ rec@@ t .
he could not re@@ si@@ st the t@@ em@@ p@@ t@@ ation .
why didn &apos;t you come ear@@ li@@ er ?
g@@ en@@ er@@ ally spea@@ king , Japanese wo@@ men are mo@@ de@@ st .
you need to be pret@@ ty f@@ it to ru@@ n up si@@ x f@@ li@@ gh@@ ts of sta@@ ir@@ s .

Tom is the youn@@ ge@@ st child in his family .
o@@ k@@ ay , Tom , you can open your ey@@ es now !

Mary doesn &apos;t like par@@ sle@@ y .
these f@@ ac@@ ts ad@@ m@@ it of no con@@ tra@@ dic@@ tion .
you can think of the re@@ st yourself .
first , let &apos;s talk about what Tom did .
why isn &apos;t Tom doing that ?
a lar@@ ge c@@ row@@ d had ga@@ th@@ ered on the stre@@ et .
Mary could tell by the way Tom s@@ la@@ m@@ med the door that he wasn &apos;t happy .
Tom now w@@ ears a wi@@ g .
she sin@@ gs in the cho@@ ir .
S@@ o@@ me@@ how , Tom knew .
is K@@ i@@ m J@@ ong ill or is K@@ i@@ m J@@ ong o@@ k@@ ay ?
my off@@ ice is in my ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment .
there &apos;s a lot we don &apos;t know .
I think Tom can help .
he asked for some money .
does Tom know about it ?
he o@@ w@@ n@@ s a lot of land .
Tom wanted to po@@ lish his sho@@ es .
he made his will last year .
on this side of the m@@ oun@@ tain , it doesn &apos;t rain much .
do you have R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ an ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ ers ?
the pri@@ s@@ on@@ ers f@@ led from the con@@ cen@@ tr@@ ation ca@@ m@@ p .
she &apos;s lost a lot of we@@ ight since she went on a di@@ et .
how long has she been si@@ ck ?
which do you like better , s@@ k@@ at@@ ing or s@@ ki@@ ing ?
P@@ at@@ ri@@ ci@@ a ap@@ pro@@ a@@ ch@@ ed the house .
Tom is a h@@ il@@ l@@ b@@ il@@ ly .
I need some b@@ lu@@ e pa@@ int .
Tom doesn &apos;t have many friends in Boston .
th@@ ank you for b@@ rin@@ g@@ ing that up .
could you turn it down ?
I know you love Tom .
have you already met her ?
Tom si@@ g@@ ned the do@@ cu@@ m@@ ents .
Tom ma@@ j@@ or@@ ed in ch@@ em@@ i@@ st@@ ry .
you &apos;re ab@@ so@@ lu@@ t@@ ely right .
I &apos;ll be home by mi@@ d@@ night at the lat@@ est .
my c@@ at w@@ ei@@ gh@@ s about ten p@@ oun@@ ds .
just won@@ der@@ ing how you are doing .
in the old days , things were a lot si@@ m@@ pl@@ er .
do you know how to use this ma@@ ch@@ ine ?
Tom s@@ at qu@@ i@@ e@@ tly star@@ ing at the fir@@ e .
give me something to write with .
the comm@@ it@@ te@@ e is made up of ten me@@ mb@@ ers .
the world beg@@ an without man and it sh@@ all end without him .
I have made my de@@ c@@ is@@ ion .
good af@@ ter@@ no@@ on .
she met him for brea@@ k@@ fast .
that would take too long .
everybody was ga@@ th@@ ered in the li@@ ving room .
what &apos;re you going to do about these co@@ ck@@ ro@@ a@@ ch@@ es ?
it &apos;s not comp@@ li@@ c@@ ated .
did you just me@@ et her ?
most people think so .
s@@ it down on the b@@ en@@ ch .
this lar@@ ge so@@ f@@ a would be out of place in a small room .
tell me more .
year 2@@ 0@@ 1@@ 1 &apos;s most no@@ t@@ or@@ i@@ ous ex@@ pres@@ sion is &quot; K@@ e@@ ba@@ b m@@ ur@@ d@@ ers . &quot;
Tom wants to fin@@ ish doing what he &apos;s doing before he go@@ es home .
everyone thin@@ ks the same thing .
the more time I sp@@ end doing this , the less time I have to do things I en@@ jo@@ y doing .
Tom had to live with the con@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ ces of his ac@@ ti@@ ons .
wa@@ it unti@@ l tomorrow morning .
don &apos;t tell me you &apos;re tired already .
d@@ ear me , what pret@@ ty d@@ an@@ c@@ ing @-@ sho@@ es !

p@@ aper cat@@ ch@@ es fir@@ e ea@@ s@@ il@@ y .

please get these p@@ ap@@ ers out of the way .

I think it is mor@@ ally wrong to eat people .

do you like por@@ k lo@@ in ?
we have to use the sta@@ ir@@ s because the el@@ e@@ v@@ at@@ or is out of or@@ der .
you &apos;re never s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed .
Tom and I had a long con@@ ver@@ s@@ ation while we were waiting for Mary .
I don &apos;t want Tom to hear about this .
I didn &apos;t even get an inv@@ it@@ ation .
th@@ us I have heard .
a so@@ ci@@ e@@ ty without re@@ li@@ g@@ ion is like a shi@@ p without a comp@@ ass .
Tom is b@@ le@@ e@@ ding .
how much in@@ to@@ l@@ er@@ ance are we pre@@ par@@ ed to to@@ l@@ er@@ ate ?
I wish I &apos;d had more time to pre@@ p@@ are .

they did away with the old s@@ y@@ st@@ em .
his mother died when he was young , and his gr@@ and@@ mother br@@ ought him up .
P@@ a@@ ul@@ a was called away on ur@@ g@@ ent bu@@ sin@@ ess .
you must on no ac@@ coun@@ t do such a thing .
she speaks H@@ e@@ b@@ re@@ w with her mother and P@@ o@@ lish with her father .

Tom loved sp@@ or@@ ts .

Tom looked like he was ready to ju@@ m@@ p out a windo@@ w .
Mary knew that Tom had o@@ ver@@ heard John and her talking about him .
M@@ at@@ the@@ w drea@@ ded all wo@@ men exc@@ ept M@@ ar@@ il@@ l@@ a and M@@ r@@ s@@ . R@@ a@@ ch@@ el ; he had an un@@ com@@ for@@ table fe@@ el@@ ing that the my@@ st@@ er@@ i@@ ous cre@@ at@@ u@@ res were se@@ cre@@ tly la@@ ugh@@ ing at him .

I went to the station .
Tom ga@@ ined we@@ ight .
the su@@ per@@ mar@@ k@@ et didn &apos;t have what I wanted .
I &apos;ll never see her again .

you understand more than me about this sor@@ t of thing .
I cannot tell you how dis@@ gu@@ sted I f@@ el@@ t with my@@ self when I re@@ ali@@ z@@ ed what I was doing .
Tom is u@@ p@@ sta@@ ir@@ s p@@ ac@@ king .
Tom &apos;s con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous .
I can &apos;t understand why he did that .
it is not what you read but how you read it that coun@@ ts .

after it ra@@ ins and the gr@@ ound is da@@ m@@ p , it &apos;s ea@@ si@@ er to pu@@ ll wee@@ ds .
Tom can &apos;t ex@@ pl@@ ain what happened .

he rec@@ ei@@ ved quite a few le@@ tt@@ ers this morning .
Tom didn &apos;t tell us what happened that night .
ask Mary if she has enough money to buy what she nee@@ ds .
I didn &apos;t know the tru@@ th unti@@ l yesterday .
P@@ ro@@ du@@ c@@ ti@@ v@@ ity is the em@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ e@@ e &apos;s most im@@ port@@ ant ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ i@@ st@@ ic .

I bought a s@@ and@@ wi@@ ch .

Tom can &apos;t re@@ ti@@ re .
how was your h@@ on@@ ey@@ mo@@ on ?

Tom inv@@ ited Mary to jo@@ in him and his family for din@@ ner .
he &apos;s Tom &apos;s c@@ ha@@ u@@ ffe@@ u@@ r .
I &apos;m alone now .
it wasn &apos;t that hard .
I &apos;ve never told anyone before .
it &apos;s cer@@ tain that G@@ e@@ or@@ ge will come .
it prob@@ ab@@ ly would be ch@@ e@@ aper some@@ where else .
Mary and Alice both used to be Tom &apos;s gir@@ l@@ friends .

I think I &apos;m a pret@@ ty good wr@@ it@@ er .

the e@@ ff@@ ect was im@@ me@@ di@@ ate .
the work must be compl@@ e@@ ted by tomorrow .
he &apos;s on his way .
let Tom do this .
Tom is a fir@@ e ea@@ ter .
Tom has a lot of friends in Boston .
a well @-@ made c@@ up of coffee should re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e no c@@ rea@@ m or su@@ ga@@ r .
J@@ an@@ e k@@ ept s@@ il@@ ent for a long time .

I &apos;ll call the po@@ lice .
I &apos;m not sure right now .

Tom came to help .
I haven &apos;t read the re@@ por@@ t .

my brother s@@ ends you his w@@ ar@@ m re@@ gar@@ ds .

didn &apos;t I tell you to cl@@ ose the door ?
Tom didn &apos;t exp@@ ect Mary to be so fri@@ en@@ d@@ ly .
Tom and Mary wal@@ ked out of the cl@@ as@@ s@@ room .
I ma@@ j@@ or@@ ed in ch@@ em@@ i@@ st@@ ry when I was in col@@ le@@ ge .
E@@ u@@ ro@@ pe has more cu@@ l@@ ture !
O@@ p@@ pos@@ it@@ ion to the e@@ mb@@ ar@@ go was g@@ row@@ ing .
I don &apos;t think Tom tried hard enough .
Tom read a lot .
three years is a long time , I feel .
the re@@ su@@ l@@ ts were a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing .
Tom said it wasn &apos;t ne@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ary .
don &apos;t for@@ get that it &apos;s Tom &apos;s bir@@ th@@ day tomorrow .

ma@@ y@@ be she knows the answer .
they told me I had to help you .

Tom and Mary only speak French to their children .
I do want to do the si@@ gh@@ ts of K@@ yo@@ to .

I am sor@@ ry to hear that .
J@@ es@@ us ha@@ tes you .

Tom said that he thought that he might be al@@ low@@ ed to do that again .
it &apos;s a s@@ ha@@ me you don &apos;t speak F@@ in@@ n@@ ish .
Tom has done something stu@@ p@@ id .
there was no ir@@ r@@ it@@ ation on his par@@ t .
the ac@@ cu@@ sed th@@ i@@ e@@ f is on tri@@ al now .
Ch@@ in@@ a is a ma@@ j@@ or e@@ con@@ o@@ mi@@ c po@@ wer , with one of the fa@@ st@@ est g@@ row@@ ing e@@ con@@ o@@ mi@@ es in the world .
Tom didn &apos;t know anyone in the room .

Tom and Mary cl@@ in@@ ked their gl@@ as@@ ses together .
kee@@ ping the su@@ it on , D@@ im@@ a wal@@ ked out of the chang@@ ing room and st@@ ated that he wanted to make the p@@ ur@@ c@@ ha@@ se .
Tom doesn &apos;t like ho@@ t food .

&quot; would you mind op@@ en@@ ing the windo@@ w ? &quot; &quot; of c@@ our@@ se not . &quot;
last S@@ at@@ ur@@ day , my family went to the z@@ o@@ o to see the p@@ and@@ as .

Tom and Mary dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sed their fu@@ ture plan@@ s together .
I &apos;m f@@ ed up with your con@@ st@@ ant com@@ pla@@ in@@ ing .
Mary told Tom that she thought John was exc@@ ited .
he has already had l@@ un@@ ch .
why don &apos;t you have one ?
I deci@@ ded to tell him that I love her .
I have to know why .
Tom be@@ came ang@@ ry .

I &apos;m of the op@@ in@@ ion that he should ap@@ o@@ lo@@ gi@@ ze to his teacher .
I like to play the pi@@ an@@ o .

Tom asked me if I had ever done that .
Tom is a good hu@@ s@@ b@@ and and a good father .

I can &apos;t b@@ ear that f@@ el@@ low .
pri@@ ces are going up .
in my op@@ in@@ ion , stre@@ ss @-@ f@@ ree lear@@ ning is the most e@@ ff@@ ec@@ ti@@ ve .
he gave an ac@@ coun@@ t of his tri@@ p .
he dis@@ app@@ ear@@ ed without a tra@@ ce .
ever since I lear@@ ned about the ex@@ i@@ st@@ ence of the un@@ i@@ ver@@ s@@ ity , I wanted to go there .
Tom and Mary told John that they were dis@@ c@@ our@@ ag@@ ed .

Tom has lo@@ ts of friends to help him .
Tom is im@@ po@@ li@@ te .

are you going to do something about it ?
that boy is Tom .
I didn &apos;t want to leave before the work was compl@@ e@@ ted .

Tom doesn &apos;t se@@ em to be as to@@ l@@ er@@ ant as Mary seems to be .
one day I met him .
Tom and Mary told John that they were in@@ no@@ cent .

there are things in this world which si@@ m@@ pl@@ y cannot be ex@@ pres@@ sed in the for@@ m of wor@@ ds .
are you on the comm@@ it@@ te@@ e ?
we know what happened next .
it &apos;s diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t for me to sol@@ ve this problem .

did you know Tom and Mary were c@@ ou@@ sin@@ s ?

can you ex@@ pl@@ ain why ?
her friend is a sin@@ ger .
how did you know what she wanted ?
that resp@@ on@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ty is a b@@ ur@@ d@@ en to him .
how are you ?
Tom has a big n@@ ose .
there &apos;s a big party at his place .

Tom beg@@ an to like Mary more and more .
wa@@ it , you gu@@ ys .
I had an e@@ g@@ g s@@ and@@ wi@@ ch for l@@ un@@ ch .
Tom usu@@ ally only w@@ ears his gl@@ as@@ ses when he &apos;s reading .
she left her son a lot of money .
Tom went out .
hard work en@@ ab@@ led him to get good mar@@ ks .
I wish you were here .
by the time you get out of pri@@ son , she &apos;ll be married .
since Tom &apos;s T@@ a@@ ver@@ n has started off@@ er@@ ing a de@@ li@@ very ser@@ vi@@ ce too , it has been f@@ loo@@ ded with phone cal@@ ls .
you took it out of the o@@ ven too soon .
Tom has ap@@ o@@ lo@@ gi@@ z@@ ed for his comm@@ ents .
this woman is not from S@@ y@@ ri@@ a .
it &apos;s bad for bu@@ sin@@ ess .
Tom went di@@ rec@@ tly to his room as soon as he got home .
does that me@@ an something ?
he gave his life for his country .
&quot; did you k@@ ill Mary ? &quot; &quot; no , I did not . &quot;
make a pre@@ dic@@ tion .
D@@ ol@@ ph@@ ins are so@@ ci@@ al an@@ im@@ als .
did that un@@ cle of his often vis@@ it Amer@@ ic@@ a ?
I couldn &apos;t put up with that no@@ i@@ se any lon@@ ger .
never mind Tom .
it happ@@ en@@ s more often than you would think .
I tried to for@@ ce my@@ self to stay a@@ wa@@ ke .
do you know anyone who &apos;s g@@ one to Boston ?
Tom is ob@@ se@@ s@@ sed with A@@ n@@ ci@@ ent E@@ g@@ y@@ p@@ t .
Tom bought a new ca@@ se for his sa@@ x@@ op@@ h@@ one .
I am inv@@ est@@ ing money into this ven@@ ture .

there is a man at the door who wants to see you .
he &apos;s here to sp@@ y on us .
where did you two me@@ et ?
he gave me back the change .
where did you learn to d@@ ance like this ?
he could not take ex@@ a@@ min@@ ation on ac@@ coun@@ t of his il@@ l@@ ne@@ ss .

what ma@@ kes you think that Tom &apos;s interest@@ ed in hel@@ ping us ?
I &apos;m si@@ ck of ea@@ ting f@@ ish .
these p@@ il@@ lar@@ s sup@@ por@@ t the st@@ age .
I gave my word to Tom that I wouldn &apos;t do that .
Tom and Mary are almost fin@@ ished doing that .
in English the ver@@ b pre@@ ce@@ d@@ es the ob@@ j@@ ect .
you haven &apos;t heard the h@@ al@@ f of it yet .
he &apos;s an early bir@@ d .
he &apos;s c@@ raz@@ y about me .
as far as the ey@@ e could see , nothing could be seen exc@@ ept cor@@ n@@ fi@@ el@@ ds .
did Tom say anything before he died ?
Tom e@@ ven@@ tu@@ ally deci@@ ded to do that .
it &apos;s a wa@@ r cri@@ me .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done what you say he did .
I like com@@ ic boo@@ ks .
Tom se@@ ar@@ ch@@ ed his me@@ mor@@ y .
everything will turn out f@@ ine .
the B@@ er@@ l@@ in w@@ all was bu@@ il@@ t to pre@@ v@@ ent E@@ a@@ st Ger@@ m@@ ans from f@@ le@@ e@@ ing to the W@@ est .
Tom thought he had all the time in the world .
you look bor@@ ed .
I can &apos;t a@@ ff@@ or@@ d to eat in such an exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant .
his you@@ ng@@ er brother went to S@@ h@@ ang@@ ha@@ i the day before yesterday .
Tom &apos;s as b@@ al@@ d as a b@@ ad@@ ger , but he had a fu@@ ll hea@@ d of hair when he was young .
she has an ex@@ tra@@ or@@ din@@ ary ab@@ i@@ li@@ ty in mu@@ si@@ c .

I never wanted to do this .
what else do you need ?
A@@ l@@ low me to in@@ t@@ ro@@ du@@ ce M@@ a@@ y@@ u@@ k@@ o to you .

Tom asked me if I wasn &apos;t fe@@ el@@ ing well .
Mary swi@@ ms as fast as J@@ ack .
Tom said he &apos;d never been in a m@@ ot@@ or@@ bo@@ at .
you need to be car@@ e@@ ful .

I need a k@@ ni@@ fe .
it &apos;s a b@@ it in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ at@@ ing .
per@@ h@@ ap@@ s Tom can help you find a job .
have you ever told me the tru@@ th ?
the h@@ eat doesn &apos;t se@@ em to bo@@ ther Tom at all .
I d@@ ro@@ ve Tom to the h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ al .

I can do it in a week .
you had better put on your cr@@ as@@ h hel@@ met .
give some me@@ at to the dog .
he p@@ as@@ sed the ex@@ am .
you must be more car@@ e@@ ful about sp@@ el@@ ling and p@@ un@@ c@@ tu@@ ation .
can we have a mo@@ ment alone ?
there are a few nu@@ cl@@ ear bo@@ m@@ b sh@@ el@@ t@@ ers in the c@@ ity .
he &apos;s already a man .
she gre@@ e@@ ted me po@@ li@@ t@@ ely .
&quot; what was that ? &quot; &quot; nothing . &quot;
the f@@ ish was not f@@ re@@ sh .
could you take our picture ?
Tom is hi@@ gh@@ ly in@@ tel@@ li@@ g@@ ent .
Tom is co@@ ck@@ sure .
the children were swi@@ mm@@ ing na@@ ked .

Tom told Mary to come back lat@@ er .
Tom nee@@ ds you here .
Tom has already started .
of c@@ our@@ se they &apos;re f@@ as@@ ci@@ st@@ s .
I met your parents yesterday .
this matter is of great im@@ port@@ ance .
I think Tom would di@@ sa@@ g@@ ree .
you are compl@@ et@@ ely right .
that is why I was late for cl@@ ass yesterday .
this p@@ ho@@ to is too bl@@ ur@@ ry . I can &apos;t make out your face .
some@@ day the new re@@ se@@ ar@@ ch work will be compl@@ e@@ ted .
Tom will get over it .
Tom ho@@ p@@ es that he can vis@@ it Boston before he di@@ es .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;re sle@@ ep@@ y .
that wasn &apos;t ne@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ary .
it is no use pre@@ ten@@ ding you know nothing about it .
you put far too much pe@@ p@@ p@@ er in it .
I ba@@ ked him some bro@@ w@@ ni@@ es .
E@@ met s@@ at at my be@@ d@@ side for ten hours .
what time is good for you ?
I think Tom and Mary are thir@@ st@@ y .

str@@ ong lea@@ der@@ shi@@ p was nee@@ ded .
why aren &apos;t we doing that ?
c@@ li@@ ck on &quot; sa@@ ve &quot; to beg@@ in the do@@ w@@ n@@ lo@@ ad .
I never lear@@ ned how to write .
Mary told Tom she wanted John to t@@ each him how to do that .
very si@@ m@@ ple was my ex@@ plan@@ ation , and pla@@ u@@ sible enough - as most wrong the@@ or@@ ies are !
they con@@ t@@ in@@ u@@ ed the ex@@ per@@ im@@ ent day and night .
don &apos;t be c@@ raz@@ y .
he said to me , &apos; I read this book yesterday &apos; .
Tom and Mary ate C@@ hi@@ ck@@ en K@@ i@@ e@@ v .
where is my p@@ en ?
the al@@ ar@@ m went off at fi@@ ve @-@ thir@@ ty .

Tom doesn &apos;t know how de@@ ep the p@@ ool is .
Mary is a tal@@ en@@ ted ac@@ tre@@ ss .
I didn &apos;t t@@ ou@@ ch anything .
he couldn &apos;t see very far because of the fo@@ g .
what are you doing here ? why aren &apos;t you at home ?

Tom doesn &apos;t want to go to col@@ le@@ ge .
Tom got k@@ ic@@ ked out of school .

I got him to stop s@@ mo@@ king .

I know that this doesn &apos;t inter@@ est you .
I &apos;ll sup@@ por@@ t you as long as I live .
I would like to be alone .
I can &apos;t leave Tom be@@ h@@ ind .

C@@ a@@ th@@ y can speak French and German .
my house is your house .

I never read the book .
Tom , come here , I want you .

it &apos;s already too late .
where would you like to go ?
out of tw@@ en@@ ty stud@@ ents , only one had read the book .
she only bu@@ ys se@@ con@@ d @-@ h@@ and clo@@ thing .
Tom was sen@@ sible .
this road c@@ ur@@ ves g@@ en@@ tly to the right .

Tom ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t been gi@@ ving me any at@@ ten@@ tion rec@@ en@@ tly .
we &apos;re getting there .
how many ap@@ ple tre@@ es are there in your or@@ ch@@ ard ?
are ti@@ ck@@ e@@ ts for the con@@ cer@@ t a@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ able here ?
N@@ ep@@ t@@ un@@ e is the f@@ ar@@ the@@ st plan@@ et from the S@@ u@@ n .

this morning the wea@@ ther is fri@@ gh@@ t@@ ful .
how long did it take you to tr@@ ans@@ late this book ?
T@@ on@@ y was happy .
I can &apos;t make a de@@ c@@ is@@ ion about that right now .
she often ea@@ ts brea@@ k@@ fast there .
we saw J@@ an@@ e swi@@ mm@@ ing ac@@ r@@ os@@ s the ri@@ ver .
why don &apos;t you just ask her ?
they can &apos;t see you .
what do they do here ?
I have to do this .

Tom is in bed with a cold .
may I inter@@ ru@@ p@@ t you ?
try to stay a@@ wa@@ ke .
it &apos;s a s@@ ha@@ me Tom couldn &apos;t make it to your party .
Tom found the wal@@ let he thought he &apos;d lost after se@@ ar@@ ch@@ ing the house from to@@ p to bot@@ t@@ om .
my mother made me a s@@ wea@@ ter .
how do you like that ?
what does Tom &apos;s new car look like ?
work s@@ low@@ ly .

Tom in@@ h@@ er@@ ited his f@@ ar@@ m from his father .
I &apos;m not as heal@@ th@@ y as I used to be .
that &apos;s not the only reason .
Tom put on a co@@ at .
just p@@ ass such an in@@ su@@ l@@ t .
B@@ e@@ w@@ are that you don &apos;t get into tr@@ ou@@ ble .
you can for@@ get about that .
how about you ?
I don &apos;t think you want that .
J@@ e@@ f@@ f wor@@ e the ti@@ e K@@ i@@ m had gi@@ ven him for a bir@@ th@@ day pres@@ ent .
Tom and Mary took a sel@@ fi@@ e together .
I &apos;ve made things wor@@ se .

we &apos;re beg@@ in@@ n@@ ers , but we learn qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
I need to put some g@@ as in the car , as it &apos;s almost em@@ p@@ ty .
we &apos;re still in Boston .

I saw a s@@ ha@@ do@@ w mo@@ ve be@@ h@@ ind that t@@ ree !

we &apos;re reading .
would you be kind enough to put in a word for me ?
I &apos;m not coming .
she left home with everything she o@@ w@@ ned .
the money will car@@ ry us for about a mon@@ th .
Tom tel@@ ls it like it is .
we &apos;re not going any@@ where .
I &apos;m being looked after .
this book is su@@ it@@ able for g@@ en@@ er@@ al rea@@ d@@ ers .
I vis@@ ited c@@ it@@ ies such as N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k , C@@ hi@@ ca@@ go and Boston .
I &apos;ll say this : I am in@@ no@@ cent .
Tom wo@@ ke up a little after I did .
please don &apos;t ask Tom .
the stor@@ m de@@ st@@ ro@@ yed the whole to@@ wn .
Tom is a bad li@@ a@@ r .
we bought our new ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ s a clo@@ ck as a hou@@ se@@ w@@ ar@@ m@@ ing gi@@ ft .
P@@ ar@@ is is called the C@@ ity of L@@ i@@ gh@@ ts . many beautiful bu@@ il@@ din@@ gs are li@@ t at night .
we tried to put out the fir@@ e but we were un@@ su@@ cc@@ es@@ s@@ ful . we had to call the fir@@ e b@@ ri@@ ga@@ de .
how is the wea@@ ther in Boston ?
Tom is tal@@ l@@ er than any of the other ki@@ ds in his cl@@ ass .
Tom didn &apos;t m@@ en@@ tion you by name .
D@@ an and L@@ in@@ d@@ a are in tr@@ ou@@ ble .
what a p@@ ity !
Tom said that I could sleep on the so@@ f@@ a .
no one will be ca@@ ught by his f@@ lat@@ ter@@ y .
he is no less wi@@ se than his father .
Tom loved f@@ ish@@ ing .
your hair is too long .
he tal@@ ks too fast .
he d@@ r@@ ank three bot@@ t@@ les of be@@ er .
the man kis@@ ses the woman .
tra@@ ff@@ ic is hea@@ v@@ y on this stre@@ et .
the f@@ ool is happy .
you must st@@ ic@@ k to your pro@@ mi@@ se .
Tom b@@ ang@@ ed his k@@ ne@@ e .
the mo@@ vi@@ e was a@@ w@@ ful .
Tom isn &apos;t my b@@ os@@ s any@@ more .
brea@@ the in , brea@@ the out .
we had no u@@ nex@@ p@@ ec@@ ted in@@ ci@@ d@@ ents d@@ ur@@ ing our tri@@ p .
why didn &apos;t you believe me ?
seen from a di@@ st@@ ance , the h@@ ill looks like an el@@ ep@@ h@@ ant .
have you seen any mo@@ vi@@ es lat@@ ely ?
Tom died happy .
C@@ hi@@ ck@@ en@@ s were looking for food .
P@@ a@@ k S@@ u is not at home .
we have a lo@@ cal ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper in our c@@ ity .
the people at lar@@ ge were ag@@ a@@ in@@ st the wa@@ r .
I bought this book at the boo@@ k@@ sho@@ p in fr@@ on@@ t of the station .
you &apos;ve dis@@ app@@ o@@ in@@ ted us .
Tom is un@@ fa@@ z@@ ed .
I now live in Australia .
me@@ mor@@ y fa@@ d@@ es but the wr@@ it@@ ten word re@@ ma@@ ins .
it ma@@ kes no differ@@ ence .
Tom is ri@@ ch , but he isn &apos;t happy .
I think the first thing you might want to do is put some g@@ as@@ ol@@ ine in your car .
her ey@@ es were f@@ illed with t@@ ears when she pic@@ tur@@ ed the sa@@ d s@@ cen@@ e to h@@ er@@ self .
love your en@@ em@@ ies .

Mary is hel@@ ping her mother .
Tom hel@@ ped Mary with the la@@ un@@ d@@ ry .
Tom is still un@@ cer@@ tain about wh@@ e@@ ther to go to col@@ le@@ ge or not .
Tom told us a long story .
a hun@@ d@@ red do@@ l@@ lar@@ s is nothing .

walk this way .
G@@ u@@ i@@ de do@@ gs help bl@@ ind people .
Tom han@@ ded his son a lo@@ l@@ li@@ po@@ p .
I think that &apos;s a bad so@@ lu@@ tion .
the do@@ c@@ tor ad@@ vis@@ ed him not to eat be@@ tw@@ e@@ en me@@ als .
nobody likes to be made fu@@ n of in pu@@ b@@ li@@ c .
there is no f@@ ool like an old f@@ ool .
ma@@ y@@ be we should talk .
the house st@@ ank .
I don &apos;t t@@ each French here any@@ more .
Mary is a so@@ a@@ p o@@ per@@ a sta@@ r .
E@@ r , S@@ ir ? what &apos;s wr@@ it@@ ten on the bl@@ ac@@ k@@ bo@@ ard isn &apos;t an exp@@ on@@ enti@@ al f@@ un@@ c@@ tion but a tri@@ g@@ on@@ o@@ me@@ tri@@ c one .@@ .@@ .

Tom is pu@@ t@@ ting on his sho@@ es .
he always speaks well of her .
come here .
we saw ter@@ ri@@ ble s@@ cen@@ es on T@@ V .
heal@@ th is all I want .
I won &apos;t re@@ turn .
it &apos;s for a friend of m@@ ine .
I can think of some s@@ it@@ u@@ ati@@ ons in which a k@@ ni@@ fe would come in han@@ dy .
are you still in d@@ ou@@ b@@ t about what I have said ?
keep an ey@@ e on my su@@ it@@ ca@@ se while I buy the ti@@ ck@@ e@@ ts .
don &apos;t you have any other way of con@@ t@@ ac@@ ting Tom ?
Tom doesn &apos;t know anything about com@@ pu@@ ter pro@@ gra@@ mm@@ ing .
Mary told Tom that she was married .
what you sp@@ end time doing in your chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood a@@ ff@@ ec@@ ts the re@@ st of your life .
Tom and Mary have tr@@ ou@@ ble getting along .
my house is only fi@@ ve minu@@ tes &apos; walk from the station .
he won a s@@ il@@ ver me@@ d@@ al .
N@@ i@@ x@@ on re@@ si@@ g@@ ned before he could be im@@ p@@ ea@@ ch@@ ed .
B@@ o@@ b wanted to keep the fo@@ x at home .
Tom is th@@ or@@ ough .
he got lost while he was wal@@ king in the w@@ oo@@ ds .
Tom isn &apos;t the lea@@ st b@@ it wor@@ ried about the wea@@ ther .
the people are ang@@ ry .
have you s@@ et a d@@ ate for your we@@ d@@ ding ?
enough is enough !
French is a very interest@@ ing language .

Tom wouldn &apos;t li@@ e .
Tom stu@@ di@@ es French for an h@@ our every day before din@@ ner .
V@@ al@@ en@@ t@@ ine &apos;s D@@ ay is coming up .

P@@ ro@@ t@@ est@@ an@@ ts were in the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity .

Tom didn &apos;t take Mary ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ly .

Tom th@@ re@@ w Mary out of the ba@@ r .

I &apos;ve never been spo@@ ken to like that .
when did you get back from L@@ on@@ don ?
you should both just re@@ la@@ x .

the p@@ on@@ d is too sh@@ al@@ low for swi@@ mm@@ ing .
I &apos;ll s@@ how you what I can do .

Tom is a very in@@ f@@ lu@@ enti@@ al man .
I have a da@@ ugh@@ ter .

Tom cu@@ t Mary &apos;s hair .
this is the house in which the po@@ et li@@ ved in his chil@@ d@@ h@@ ood .
they come from the same country .
he ab@@ and@@ on@@ ed ho@@ pe .
Tom and Mary told John that they were sa@@ fe .
the ro@@ of of my house is red .
he gave him the book .
Tom didn &apos;t tru@@ st Mary as much as she tru@@ sted him .
they asked Mary to look after the children .
many s@@ on@@ gs are about un@@ re@@ qu@@ ited love .
there &apos;s one more thing you need to do .
listen to the f@@ ac@@ ts re@@ l@@ ati@@ ve to the is@@ su@@ e .
Tom cu@@ t down all the tre@@ es in his fr@@ on@@ t y@@ ard .
b@@ as@@ k@@ et@@ b@@ all is very fu@@ n to play .
I can &apos;t stay much lon@@ ger .
did you really say that ?
Tom went back home .
per@@ h@@ ap@@ s you &apos;d be w@@ il@@ ling to v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er .
I don &apos;t remember inv@@ iting you here .
I would often take a walk before brea@@ k@@ fast .
the children went to school in sp@@ ite of the rain .
the most comm@@ on s@@ y@@ m@@ p@@ t@@ om of mis@@ car@@ ri@@ age is v@@ ag@@ in@@ al b@@ le@@ e@@ ding , which may o@@ c@@ cu@@ r with or without p@@ ain .
the ne@@ go@@ ti@@ ati@@ ons made little pro@@ gre@@ ss .

G@@ ra@@ ha@@ m G@@ re@@ en@@ e is one of my fav@@ or@@ ite a@@ u@@ th@@ or@@ s .

can you p@@ r@@ on@@ oun@@ ce these wor@@ ds ?
she &apos;s an a@@ ir@@ hea@@ d .
the coffee &apos;s on me .
you must learn to see life as it is .
Tom didn &apos;t mind that Mary had small brea@@ st@@ s .
I know you aren &apos;t that stu@@ p@@ id .
I a@@ wo@@ ke from a drea@@ m .
Tom en@@ ded up in j@@ a@@ il .
Tom said he &apos;d never been to Boston .

she got the ti@@ ck@@ et for f@@ ree .
do you know that boy who &apos;s cr@@ ying ?
Tom knows who k@@ illed his dog , but he won &apos;t tell us .
I &apos;ll see you in the new year .
it &apos;s only a matter of time before the me@@ te@@ or st@@ ri@@ kes .
what was the plan ?
when I was tw@@ en@@ ty two years old , I was the ma@@ ster of the brea@@ st st@@ ro@@ ke .
our tri@@ p is de@@ pen@@ dent on the wea@@ ther .
Tom s@@ at on the f@@ loo@@ r sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded by a b@@ un@@ ch of children .
I find doing that di@@ sa@@ gre@@ ea@@ ble .
is she hi@@ ding something ?
who do you know there ?
don &apos;t be in@@ su@@ l@@ ted .
they a@@ do@@ p@@ ted a k@@ id .
I &apos;ll make sure Tom ge@@ ts your me@@ s@@ sa@@ ge .
nobody wants a wa@@ r .
where is the ti@@ ck@@ et off@@ ice ?
Tom has been away for three days .
I haven &apos;t heard from him since then .
you have no right to tell me what to do .

Tom se@@ al@@ ed the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e .
I &apos;m tired of your comm@@ ents .
stop drea@@ m@@ ing .
don &apos;t be a bad boy .
it could happ@@ en to you , too .
I &apos;ll do my best to get it for you , but I don &apos;t pro@@ mi@@ se anything .
my c@@ at is really s@@ mar@@ t .
he had hear@@ t sur@@ g@@ er@@ y .
Tom told me that he won &apos;t tell Mary what happened .
my father is as busy as ever .
it &apos;s a@@ w@@ fu@@ l@@ ly cold today .
can you pro@@ ve the v@@ ali@@ d@@ ity of your as@@ ser@@ tion ?

what is the name of this ri@@ ver ?
he isn &apos;t here now .
do you know why Tom is ab@@ s@@ ent from school ?

I broke it .

D@@ r@@ . K@@ le@@ in re@@ comm@@ en@@ ded you to me .
this book is fu@@ ll of er@@ r@@ or@@ s .
what is he talking about ? it just doesn &apos;t make sen@@ se .
of c@@ our@@ se it &apos;s a good thing when some@@ one lear@@ ning a fore@@ ig@@ n language tri@@ es to use it without f@@ ear of ma@@ king mista@@ kes , but I don &apos;t think much of people without su@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ ent ab@@ i@@ li@@ ty pro@@ du@@ c@@ ing language lear@@ ning mat@@ er@@ i@@ al of p@@ oor qu@@ al@@ ity .
do you think he will really give up ?
she tal@@ ked to the c@@ ha@@ ir@@ person .
hel@@ l@@ o , gir@@ ls .
Tom is s@@ it@@ ting on the gr@@ ass .
br@@ ing me the ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper .

we need a car big enough for the whole family .
is there anyone who can p@@ r@@ on@@ oun@@ ce this word ?
s@@ how me a ch@@ e@@ aper one , please .
Tom had no money .
Tom said he was busy .
D@@ is@@ co@@ ver the world !
F@@ ra@@ yed el@@ ec@@ tri@@ cal c@@ ab@@ les can be very d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous .
I let him sleep at my house for the night .
this kind of work is very d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous .
in sp@@ ite of all the c@@ oo@@ king sho@@ ws I &apos;ve watch@@ ed , I &apos;m still no good in the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en .
life beg@@ ins when we re@@ ali@@ ze who we really are .
Tom was very plea@@ sed .
he wal@@ ked away with a sa@@ d look on his face .
there are only boo@@ ks on the sh@@ el@@ f .
the a@@ str@@ on@@ a@@ u@@ ts went up to the mo@@ on in a ro@@ ck@@ et .
he go@@ es for a walk one day every mon@@ th .

let &apos;s have din@@ ner .
I &apos;ve been in th@@ er@@ ap@@ y since I was thir@@ te@@ en .
easy p@@ easy le@@ m@@ on s@@ qu@@ ee@@ z@@ y .
my mother is two years you@@ ng@@ er than my father .
he has a car that has f@@ our do@@ or@@ s .
I put c@@ rea@@ m in my coffee .
have you tra@@ vel@@ ed any@@ where rec@@ en@@ tly ?

I won@@ der if Tom is still ou@@ t@@ side .
I was@@ h@@ ed my han@@ ds .
John lives in N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k .
th@@ ank you very much for your letter .
Tom didn &apos;t off@@ er us anything to drink .
Tom seem@@ ed like a n@@ ice gu@@ y at first .
his name is kno@@ wn to all .
Tom for@@ got his u@@ mb@@ re@@ l@@ l@@ a in Mary &apos;s car .
she lives in the country .
stop fol@@ low@@ ing me .
I don &apos;t want to hear anything about her .
Tom asked Mary to give a sp@@ ee@@ ch .
do you ap@@ pro@@ ve of what she is doing ?
you should fol@@ low the do@@ c@@ tor &apos;s or@@ d@@ ers .
Tom &apos;s home .
it &apos;ll just take a mo@@ ment .

it &apos;s gra@@ du@@ ally getting col@@ der .
I just did that this morning .
the girl made off with her em@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ er &apos;s money .
there &apos;s ice on the si@@ de@@ walk and it &apos;s s@@ li@@ p@@ per@@ y .
we &apos;re going to do it again .
Tom loved doing that .
Tom o@@ w@@ n@@ s an e@@ sp@@ re@@ s@@ so ma@@ ch@@ ine .
I &apos;m still busy .
go away .
how did you know Tom wasn &apos;t going to be here ?
we went without him because he wasn &apos;t ready .
he is an old h@@ and at that work .
she d@@ an@@ ced so very gr@@ ac@@ e@@ fu@@ l@@ ly that they all ad@@ m@@ ir@@ ed her more and more .
I saw a str@@ ang@@ e woman there .
I can &apos;t mo@@ ve as qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly as Tom can .
he doesn &apos;t eat anything other than fr@@ u@@ it .
I saw it coming .
I always need an ex@@ tr@@ a bl@@ an@@ k@@ et in the win@@ ter@@ time .
do you have it by any ch@@ ance ?
don &apos;t you have a sen@@ se of ju@@ st@@ ice ?
could you please say that once again in French ?

one Amer@@ i@@ can s@@ ci@@ enti@@ st , W@@ il@@ li@@ am K@@ ee@@ ton , used a very interest@@ ing ex@@ per@@ im@@ ent to sol@@ ve this my@@ st@@ er@@ y .
the tre@@ es were in a row .
I remember her face , but I don &apos;t remember her name .
you must get up at si@@ x .
Tom doesn &apos;t know much about mu@@ si@@ c .
he would give an ar@@ m and a le@@ g for that .
I &apos;ve asked you this question before .
Tom has th@@ ic@@ k hair .
I want to sp@@ end the whole day with you .
Tom ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t ans@@ w@@ ered my letter yet .
do you know who said that ?
they have a plan .
please don &apos;t li@@ e to me .

after you , Tom .
look at the picture .
let &apos;s keep this matter to our@@ sel@@ ves .
Tom didn &apos;t think he was comm@@ it@@ ting a cri@@ me .
Tom wor@@ ked very hard today .
I &apos;m sor@@ ry . I won &apos;t do it ever again .
we can &apos;t pret@@ end Tom is n@@ or@@ ma@@ l .

Tom had a cold .
Tom is a very ex@@ per@@ i@@ en@@ ced an@@ n@@ oun@@ c@@ er .
just go back to the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en .
Tom doesn &apos;t drink much .
I could have done that for you .
I asked Tom and Mary what happened , but they wouldn &apos;t tell me .
this gl@@ ass con@@ ta@@ ins water .
how are you now ?
Tom wanted a word with Mary .
all the ki@@ ds I gre@@ w up with could swi@@ m before they started going to school .
call me when you get there .
I know him quite well .
I don &apos;t understand what you want .
you should w@@ ear a co@@ at .
we &apos;re like a big family here .
as a re@@ su@@ l@@ t of always being hun@@ g@@ ry and f@@ ati@@ gu@@ ed , that dog fin@@ ally died .
Tom was fa@@ m@@ ous .
there is no es@@ c@@ ap@@ e from f@@ ate .
he does not know .
it could happ@@ en to you , too .

people often take me for my brother .
I already feel much better .
if you dri@@ ve your car like that , you &apos;ll end up in h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ al .
I &apos;ll ask Mary out .
do not ask what life gi@@ ves you , ask what you give .
Tom was tr@@ ying to k@@ ill Mary .
I &apos;m just ki@@ d@@ ding .
Tom said he couldn &apos;t do that .
I was inv@@ ol@@ ved in a tra@@ ff@@ ic ac@@ cident .

Tom was too tired to walk any f@@ ur@@ ther .
c@@ le@@ an the room .

I didn &apos;t know Tom had a sp@@ or@@ ts car .

m@@ os@@ qu@@ it@@ o@@ es in M@@ in@@ ne@@ so@@ t@@ a are as big as stor@@ ks .
I already told my parents .
Tom told Mary how he and John met .
Tom looks as th@@ ough he wants to c@@ ry .
Tom has one son and two da@@ ugh@@ t@@ ers .
my house is ha@@ un@@ ted .
he can &apos;t c@@ ook very well .
come and help me out .
you cannot have your own way in everything .
could we please go home now ?
the fin@@ al mat@@ ch was not so exc@@ iting .
what a great idea !
Tom &apos;s new ca@@ mer@@ a can take i@@ ma@@ g@@ es with much hi@@ gh@@ er pi@@ x@@ el coun@@ ts than his old one could .
I &apos;ll ask you these quest@@ i@@ ons .
he took to A@@ ki@@ k@@ o from the mo@@ ment he met her .
we don &apos;t have that in@@ for@@ m@@ ation .
Tom and I &apos;ll be in the lo@@ b@@ by waiting for you .
my j@@ e@@ ans sh@@ r@@ ank in the was@@ h .
I wish we could go back to the way things were before .
he asked her some quest@@ i@@ ons .
I &apos;d like to v@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er my ser@@ v@@ ic@@ es .
don &apos;t let him get away .
Tom &apos;s right .
Tom f@@ ro@@ ze to death .
last night , I rec@@ or@@ ded all the s@@ oun@@ ds I made while I was sle@@ ep@@ ing .
you must be the change you wish to see in the world .
it is not ac@@ c@@ ep@@ table to our mor@@ al co@@ de .
I kind of lost my fo@@ c@@ us .
I si@@ m@@ pl@@ y don &apos;t know what to say .@@ .@@ .
I must get it fi@@ x@@ ed .
this book is far ab@@ o@@ ve me .
since I was little I have loved going to the se@@ a with my family .
do you think you &apos;re o@@ be@@ se ?
C@@ on@@ gre@@ ss p@@ as@@ sed the b@@ ill .
we &apos;re going to name him Tom .
they say he &apos;s the best ten@@ n@@ is pla@@ y@@ er .
how can I tell it just to Tom without tel@@ ling everybody else ?
have you already made friends with her ?
Tom didn &apos;t know what was going on .
answer me !
everyone in the car said they wanted to get out and stre@@ t@@ ch their le@@ gs .
I want to be an a@@ str@@ on@@ a@@ u@@ t .
a r@@ at r@@ an ac@@ r@@ os@@ s the road .
how is this even possible ?
I cannot do the work on my own .
some@@ times I wish I had a tw@@ in brother . that &apos;d be fu@@ n .
such a tri@@ vi@@ al thing is out of the question .
I s@@ at in the waiting room for what seem@@ ed like hours .
Mary im@@ me@@ di@@ at@@ ely re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ z@@ ed his vo@@ ice . it was Tom !
how many people are in this room ?
these t@@ y@@ p@@ es of boo@@ ks have almost no v@@ al@@ u@@ e .
there &apos;s still a lot to do .
should S@@ co@@ t@@ land be an in@@ de@@ pen@@ dent country ?
Tom will be f@@ ree tomorrow .
how I wish I could go , too !
his ey@@ es fa@@ il@@ ed him .
Tom couldn &apos;t remember what Mary had told him to do .
we plan@@ ted pe@@ an@@ u@@ ts in@@ st@@ ea@@ d of co@@ t@@ ton .
it looks like you had a t@@ ough day .
E@@ ro@@ s is the G@@ re@@ e@@ k go@@ d of love .
she made no resp@@ on@@ se to my question .
there &apos;s nothing to be done about it .
he made his way through the c@@ row@@ d .
Tom &apos;s well .
I re@@ comm@@ end Tom .
I &apos;m a beg@@ in@@ ner , too .
Tom bought a car u@@ sing his sa@@ v@@ in@@ gs .
he can be p@@ r@@ ou@@ d of his father .
get out of bed !
I go to school on f@@ oo@@ t .
Tom pre@@ f@@ ers do@@ gs to cat@@ s .
don &apos;t come n@@ ear me . I have a cold .
I &apos;d do anything for her .
W@@ o@@ e be@@ ti@@ de the child who speaks cor@@ rec@@ t English ; he will be the la@@ ugh@@ ing @-@ sto@@ ck of his cl@@ as@@ s@@ mat@@ es .
you have to be ac@@ ti@@ ve .
I would very much app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate rec@@ ei@@ ving a co@@ p@@ y of the book .
he is doing a sup@@ er job .
L@@ i@@ is@@ a and M@@ ar@@ k@@ k@@ u are enti@@ re@@ ly differ@@ ent in t@@ em@@ per@@ a@@ ment and con@@ stan@@ tly at si@@ x@@ es and se@@ ven@@ s .
he stu@@ di@@ es the B@@ i@@ ble .
you can see the S@@ k@@ y@@ t@@ ree from there .
it &apos;s not true .
I &apos;m not very op@@ ti@@ mi@@ st@@ ic .
Tom called Mary a tra@@ it@@ or .
it was too late .
an Amer@@ i@@ can G@@ o@@ ver@@ n@@ ment cannot per@@ m@@ it Amer@@ ic@@ ans to star@@ ve .
last year in the P@@ hi@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ in@@ es , ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ kes and ti@@ d@@ al wa@@ ves re@@ su@@ l@@ ted in the dea@@ th@@ s of more than 6@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0 people .
a@@ ir po@@ l@@ lu@@ tion is a ser@@ i@@ ous problem in this country .
we &apos;re not sure where Tom is .
this road is too n@@ ar@@ row for car@@ s to p@@ ass .
the shi@@ r@@ t is very di@@ r@@ ty . before you go to school , it has to be was@@ h@@ ed .
I believe that st@@ ri@@ c@@ ter vi@@ g@@ il@@ ance is ne@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ary here .
o that I had so much po@@ wer !
you ought not to have said a thing like that to him .
kis@@ s Tom for me .
I want to know why you li@@ ed to me .
I &apos;m not really very thir@@ st@@ y .
I can only tell you what I know .
I &apos;m good at ten@@ n@@ is .
do you like it then ?
please be qu@@ i@@ et .
how c@@ le@@ ver !
try it once again .
he came late , as is often the ca@@ se with him .
I don &apos;t have enough money for my tri@@ p .
Tom was b@@ it@@ ten by a dog .
I &apos;m bor@@ ed to death .
no , you may not put the col@@ an@@ der on your hea@@ d ; you can be an a@@ str@@ on@@ a@@ u@@ t after I d@@ rain the pa@@ st@@ a .
Tom ate something .
the old man lost his will to live .
you can &apos;t leave me here alone with Tom .
I &apos;m doing this for them .
she thin@@ ks she &apos;s a g@@ en@@ i@@ us .
he was ac@@ ting really we@@ ir@@ d .
do you know what they want ?
Tom su@@ ff@@ ered from a hear@@ t at@@ t@@ ack and almost died waiting for the am@@ bu@@ l@@ ance .
I like to watch T@@ V .
I can &apos;t sp@@ end the re@@ st of my life li@@ ving with Tom .
I &apos;d like to play ten@@ n@@ is with you .
he cannot speak English , much less German .
it &apos;ll rain soon .
come home .
where does Tom have to do that ?
I &apos;m still un@@ deci@@ ded .
I bought two co@@ t@@ ton shi@@ r@@ ts .
don &apos;t han@@ g up , but ho@@ ld on please .
she is sin@@ g@@ ing the lat@@ est po@@ pu@@ la@@ r s@@ on@@ gs .
in g@@ en@@ er@@ al , men are tal@@ l@@ er than wo@@ men .
how long have you two been en@@ g@@ ag@@ ed ?
I think it &apos;s time for me to l@@ ose some we@@ ight .
a de@@ c@@ is@@ ion will be even more diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t the lon@@ ger you d@@ el@@ ay it .
I think Tom is s@@ mar@@ ter than Mary .
I always con@@ fu@@ se which side is por@@ t and which star@@ bo@@ ard .
this boo@@ k@@ st@@ ore st@@ op@@ ped sel@@ ling J@@ U@@ M@@ P .
I &apos;m afraid not .
wh@@ at@@ ever she told you , it &apos;s not true .
Tom has fin@@ ished un@@ p@@ ac@@ king his su@@ it@@ ca@@ se .
Tom used to help his father in the st@@ ore after school .
he made up his mind to write in his di@@ ary every day .
she beg@@ an to c@@ ry .
ho@@ w@@ ever cold it may be , he still jo@@ gs 2@@ 0 k@@ il@@ o@@ me@@ t@@ ers every day .
Tom was still a ba@@ ch@@ el@@ or then .
that &apos;s my fav@@ or@@ ite shi@@ r@@ t , and I always was@@ h it by h@@ and .
I wish I could help you .
Mary told Tom that she thought John was de@@ pen@@ d@@ able .
I had a hea@@ d@@ ac@@ he .
he is a good boy , and he is very str@@ ong .
Tom speaks exc@@ el@@ l@@ ent French , but his English isn &apos;t very good .
I was w@@ oun@@ ded by her comm@@ ents .
you need to mind your own bu@@ sin@@ ess .
he was at home .
it &apos;s Tom &apos;s turn to help was@@ h the di@@ sh@@ es .
I can be@@ at Tom .
only a thir@@ d of the stud@@ ents came to cl@@ ass today .
su@@ dd@@ en@@ ly , something u@@ nex@@ p@@ ec@@ ted happened .
and then everyone started la@@ ugh@@ ing .
do you believe in ang@@ el@@ s ?
I can do it without you .
you are hear@@ ing things .
Tom saw a girl s@@ it@@ ting all alone , so he went over to talk to her .
I asked Tom if he was n@@ er@@ v@@ ous .
when do you want to me@@ et Tom ?
I b@@ ar@@ ely had time to fin@@ ish this re@@ por@@ t before the meeting .
I went to N@@ ag@@ as@@ a@@ k@@ i .
Tom &apos;s had a lot of gir@@ l@@ friends .
Tom never com@@ pla@@ ins .
please leave me alone . I am busy .
I could sp@@ end hours in here .
our c@@ at &apos;s fu@@ r has lost its lu@@ ster .
Tom has been in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated since 2@@ 0@@ 1@@ 3 .
you &apos;re ab@@ so@@ lu@@ t@@ ely right !
this story does not make sen@@ se !
my fe@@ et are k@@ il@@ ling me .
do you have a ma@@ p of Boston ?
Tom didn &apos;t know what Mary thought of it .
I thought you might be cu@@ ri@@ ous .
that e@@ ven@@ ing I left my ti@@ p un@@ der a coffee c@@ up , which I left u@@ p@@ side down on the table .
I &apos;d ra@@ ther di@@ e than do what you &apos;re as@@ king me to do .
this is the tri@@ ck@@ y par@@ t .
I don &apos;t give a fu@@ ck about what you think .
some bo@@ ys came into the cl@@ as@@ s@@ room .
a dog is a lo@@ y@@ al an@@ i@@ ma@@ l .
Mary is ma@@ d at me because she thin@@ ks I sto@@ le her bo@@ y@@ friend .
I left the windo@@ w open .
so far as I can remember , there is not one word in the G@@ os@@ p@@ el@@ s in p@@ ra@@ i@@ se of in@@ tel@@ li@@ g@@ ence .
be con@@ t@@ ent with your lot ; one cannot be first in everything .
which is ch@@ e@@ aper , the bu@@ s or the stre@@ et car ?
been there , done that .
when was the last time you sle@@ p@@ t in this room ?
the qu@@ ar@@ re@@ l had un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ate con@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ ces .
what will I for@@ get to write ?
did you already do your ho@@ me@@ work ?
Tom seems to be de@@ pres@@ sed .
ab@@ o@@ ve all , fa@@ me me@@ ans d@@ ying at the right time .
my mother sp@@ ends a lot of money on clo@@ th@@ es .
I &apos;m sure Tom was inv@@ ol@@ ved .
a bir@@ d in the h@@ and is wor@@ th two in the bu@@ sh .
then , the train s@@ cre@@ e@@ ch@@ ed to a h@@ al@@ t .
it &apos;s a phone call from a M@@ r B@@ ro@@ wn .
who w@@ ro@@ te these le@@ tt@@ ers ?
I stu@@ dy French , too .
it &apos;s open .
the person on the left ru@@ ins the b@@ al@@ ance of the picture .
Tom wouldn &apos;t believe me .
I &apos;ll write Tom a letter .
I wish you w@@ er@@ en &apos;t always so busy .
Tom looked very young .
he is R@@ a@@ mu@@ d@@ u .
the rain ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t st@@ op@@ ped yet , has it ?
you can &apos;t do this to yourself .
it was a new ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence for her .
where there &apos;s life , there &apos;s ho@@ pe .
Tom died three days after he arrived in Boston .
don &apos;t you have to go to school today ?
did you c@@ le@@ an your room ?
what s@@ car@@ ed you ?
how does she do this ?
is that your sister ?
Tom has some ad@@ vi@@ ce for us .
E@@ st@@ on@@ i@@ a has its own n@@ ati@@ on@@ al an@@ them .
he de@@ c@@ ei@@ ves o@@ thers with his app@@ ear@@ ance .
I can &apos;t help but feel par@@ tly resp@@ on@@ sible .
I don &apos;t feel good about it .
now it &apos;s your turn .
I believe in the re@@ sur@@ rec@@ tion .
Tom is in po@@ lice cu@@ sto@@ dy now .
I would like to have a look at your col@@ le@@ c@@ tion of sta@@ m@@ ps .
n@@ one of us saw Tom and Mary do that .
were you able to make it to the station on time to cat@@ ch the first train this morning ?
she &apos;s h@@ on@@ est enough , but can you really tru@@ st her ?
he d@@ r@@ ank the wh@@ is@@ k@@ y as if it were water .
Tom ra@@ is@@ ed his gl@@ ass and said , &quot; T@@ o the happy c@@ ou@@ ple ! &quot;
how come you &apos;re so c@@ raz@@ y ?
th@@ an@@ ks , M@@ om .
Amer@@ ic@@ ans un@@ der the age of ei@@ gh@@ te@@ en aren &apos;t al@@ low@@ ed to v@@ ot@@ e in pre@@ si@@ d@@ enti@@ al el@@ ec@@ ti@@ ons .
we were able to cat@@ ch the last train .
I &apos;m g@@ la@@ d I &apos;m a man .
why don &apos;t you answer your da@@ d ?
does it often s@@ now in the win@@ ter here ?
I &apos;m sor@@ ry . I for@@ got .

the tru@@ th kno@@ c@@ ked the b@@ re@@ at@@ h out of him .
his car was ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ly da@@ ma@@ g@@ ed .
Tom said Mary is ready .
why didn &apos;t you try the dress on before you bought it ?
any@@ body is better than nobody .
O@@ K , I &apos;ll or@@ der it .
I don &apos;t c@@ are for sp@@ or@@ ts .
the boy who wr@@ it@@ es best win@@ s the pri@@ ze .
he has cor@@ por@@ al &apos;s st@@ ri@@ p@@ es .
a man who l@@ ac@@ ks re@@ s@@ our@@ ce@@ fu@@ l@@ ne@@ ss is u@@ sel@@ ess .
Tom wasn &apos;t able to change Mary &apos;s mind .
the day is sh@@ or@@ t and there &apos;s a lot of work .
Tom got here on time .
I can &apos;t stand this kind of mo@@ vi@@ e .
where do I get off ?
G@@ or@@ il@@ l@@ as cannot use their li@@ ps and t@@ on@@ gu@@ es to speak , but they can comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ate with people in other ways .
do you think French is diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t ?
how d@@ are you talk about Tom like that !
U@@ n@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , an er@@ r@@ or has o@@ cc@@ ur@@ red .
Mary told Tom that she thought John was hun@@ g@@ ry .
have you kis@@ sed her yet ?
Tom b@@ ac@@ ked out at the last mo@@ ment .
I am la@@ ugh@@ ing at Tom .
I have hun@@ dre@@ ds of such ex@@ am@@ pl@@ es in my com@@ pu@@ ter .
I &apos;m sor@@ ry to have k@@ ept you waiting .
please mo@@ ve the c@@ hair . it &apos;s in the way .
Mary first came to Boston when she was three years old .
don &apos;t s@@ cre@@ w with me !
is your car new ?
get out of the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en .
our po@@ li@@ c@@ y is to s@@ at@@ is@@ f@@ y our cu@@ sto@@ m@@ ers .
will you p@@ ass me the s@@ al@@ t , please ?
you don &apos;t have to talk to me if you don &apos;t want to .
Tom thought about what Mary had said .
Tom and Mary told John that they were ready to leave .
I can not understand the p@@ s@@ y@@ cho@@ lo@@ g@@ y of a@@ do@@ le@@ s@@ c@@ ents .
all g@@ ro@@ wn @-@ u@@ ps were once children .
do you think Tom saw it ?
Tom can swi@@ m no more than a st@@ one can .
I &apos;m fin@@ ish@@ ing my ho@@ me@@ work .
you should school yourself to be p@@ ati@@ ent .
the st@@ ore was re@@ l@@ ati@@ v@@ ely em@@ p@@ ty .
why should I p@@ ay ?
how can some@@ one who knows the language so well have such a th@@ ic@@ k ac@@ cent ?
kno@@ w@@ ing a to@@ pi@@ c is one thing , but teach@@ ing it is a whole no@@ ther story .
he ge@@ ts ma@@ d very ea@@ s@@ il@@ y .
the only time he f@@ ee@@ ds the dog is when his wife is away on a tri@@ p .
I &apos;m im@@ pres@@ sed with how much you &apos;ve im@@ pro@@ ved .
I don &apos;t get the con@@ ne@@ c@@ tion .
it &apos;s time to get up .
he was way be@@ h@@ ind on his ren@@ t . as a re@@ su@@ l@@ t , he was e@@ v@@ ic@@ ted from his ap@@ ar@@ t@@ ment .
I like c@@ oo@@ ki@@ es .
please give me back my p@@ en .
the vo@@ ice re@@ min@@ ded me of my mother .
after your death you will be what you were before your bir@@ th .
there was a s@@ mu@@ d@@ ge of li@@ p@@ st@@ ic@@ k on his ch@@ ee@@ k , and his ti@@ e was lo@@ ose .
Tom is the person who h@@ it Mary .
Tom was kind of sur@@ pri@@ sed when Mary said that she &apos;d do that .
wh@@ ose house is ac@@ r@@ os@@ s from your@@ s ?
water is as pre@@ ci@@ ous as a@@ ir .
no one was watch@@ ing us .
U@@ k@@ ra@@ in@@ i@@ an gir@@ ls are the most beautiful gir@@ ls in the world .
I went to a nu@@ de b@@ each in F@@ r@@ ance .
Tom was th@@ ou@@ gh@@ t@@ less , wasn &apos;t he ?
we &apos;d better stop .
let &apos;s go to the b@@ each .
let us b@@ ri@@ e@@ f@@ ly rec@@ all an im@@ port@@ ant re@@ su@@ l@@ t from gr@@ ou@@ p the@@ or@@ y .
R@@ o@@ man E@@ m@@ per@@ or C@@ ali@@ gu@@ l@@ a had a h@@ or@@ se called I@@ n@@ c@@ it@@ at@@ us which me@@ ans fast .
the K@@ ing and Q@@ u@@ e@@ en were o@@ ver@@ jo@@ yed when they saw their children , and they all li@@ ved happ@@ il@@ y together in the beautiful p@@ al@@ a@@ ce .
Tom and Mary told John that they thought Alice was su@@ sp@@ ic@@ i@@ ous .
there &apos;s an ap@@ ple in this boy &apos;s po@@ ck@@ et .
Tom might be C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an .
it &apos;s a p@@ ity that I don &apos;t understand French better .
let &apos;s see .
my mother s@@ ent me a bir@@ th@@ day pres@@ ent .
M@@ r@@ . K@@ a@@ to teach@@ es us English .
I wanted to help you .
Tom is hi@@ ding in his room again .
Tom , ho@@ w@@ ever , was already in love with a girl called Mary .
Tom cl@@ os@@ ed the door qu@@ i@@ e@@ tly .
Tom took off his hea@@ d@@ ph@@ on@@ es .
she gave me her phone nu@@ mber .
the c@@ at c@@ ha@@ sed the m@@ ou@@ se , but couldn &apos;t cat@@ ch it .
she just wanted to get ri@@ d of me .
when are you going to give me my book back ?
sh@@ u@@ t up . if you don &apos;t , you &apos;ll be th@@ ro@@ wn out .
my pen@@ ci@@ l is red .
please think it over and let me know your de@@ c@@ is@@ ion .
who is sup@@ pos@@ ed to do this job ?
he s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed his thir@@ st with a lar@@ ge gl@@ ass of be@@ er .
&quot; have you got yourself a ti@@ ck@@ et yet ? &quot; - &quot; N@@ o , have you ? &quot;
would Tom really buy that for you ?
the ti@@ p of the k@@ ni@@ fe is sh@@ ar@@ p .
it happened that the day was my bir@@ th@@ day .
I &apos;ve mis@@ sed Tom .
we were stud@@ ying all af@@ ter@@ no@@ on .
she fol@@ ded it in p@@ aper .
was it good ?
Tom drin@@ ks .
it &apos;s a sh@@ or@@ t walk .
the Japanese have a lot in comm@@ on with the Ch@@ in@@ ese .
I want Tom ar@@ re@@ sted for m@@ ur@@ der .
do you feel any p@@ ain in your sto@@ ma@@ ch ?
does anyone still do that ?
I &apos;m really happy I r@@ an into you .
she turned on the light .
I have no ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tion to your op@@ in@@ ion .
Tom un@@ lo@@ c@@ ked the fr@@ on@@ t g@@ ate .
Tom and Mary told John that they thought Alice wasn &apos;t alone .
Japanese people are for@@ t@@ un@@ ate to live in a land with n@@ at@@ ur@@ al ho@@ t sp@@ rin@@ gs .
Mary was off@@ en@@ ded when Tom bought her some b@@ re@@ at@@ h f@@ re@@ sh@@ en@@ er .
there always seems like there is something to do .
I have to re@@ fu@@ se your off@@ er , as t@@ em@@ p@@ ting as it might be .
some people think it &apos;s a bad idea .
Tom in@@ su@@ l@@ ted Mary .
do you think they &apos;re coming after us ?
Tom con@@ si@@ der@@ ed the s@@ it@@ u@@ ation car@@ e@@ fu@@ l@@ ly .
what are you doing in Boston ?
the ga@@ me w@@ ar@@ d@@ en asked Tom for his hun@@ ting li@@ cen@@ se .
Tom &apos;s already here , but B@@ ill ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t come yet .
do we have any mil@@ k left ?
Tom gave his son some fa@@ th@@ er@@ ly ad@@ vi@@ ce .
I &apos;ve been waiting for him for an h@@ our .
we &apos;ve for@@ gi@@ ven you .
the most in@@ fa@@ m@@ ous ex@@ pres@@ sion for the year 2@@ 0@@ 1@@ 1 is &quot; K@@ e@@ ba@@ b m@@ ur@@ d@@ ers . &quot;
he pa@@ in@@ ted the door over wh@@ ite .
the tre@@ es are plan@@ ted at inter@@ v@@ als of thir@@ ty me@@ t@@ ers .
she said she would be tw@@ en@@ ty years old the fol@@ low@@ ing year .
if S@@ pen@@ s@@ er doesn &apos;t keep ad@@ ding and tr@@ ans@@ lat@@ ing sen@@ ten@@ ces , the other con@@ tri@@ bu@@ t@@ or@@ s will su@@ re@@ ly sur@@ p@@ ass him .
the young boy hel@@ ped the old woman .
how do you a@@ vo@@ id s@@ n@@ ac@@ king be@@ tw@@ e@@ en me@@ als ?
Tom and Mary knew that I &apos;d be g@@ one by the time they got there .
I have a family .
we sh@@ are the hou@@ se@@ work .
cat@@ s that are compl@@ et@@ ely wh@@ ite with b@@ lu@@ e ey@@ es are always , or ne@@ ar@@ ly always , dea@@ f .
this book is of great use to us .
the children tried to im@@ it@@ ate their teacher .
everyone knows us .
Tom turned on the T@@ V .
these gl@@ as@@ ses are beautiful .
can you si@@ m@@ p@@ li@@ f@@ y the j@@ ar@@ g@@ on for me ?
they left there the day before yesterday .
you can &apos;t say a word about this to anyone .
what is the next stop ?
you ought to be as@@ ha@@ med .
what ac@@ coun@@ t can you give of your mis@@ be@@ ha@@ vi@@ or ?
we lost si@@ ght of them over h@@ al@@ f an h@@ our ag@@ o .
ma@@ y@@ be after ea@@ ster , sp@@ r@@ ing will come .
when did Tom find out ?
stop being p@@ es@@ si@@ mi@@ st@@ ic ! everything will sor@@ t it@@ self out .
let &apos;s not play .
Tom wants to talk to all of us .
look after the pen@@ ni@@ es and the p@@ oun@@ ds will look after the@@ m@@ sel@@ ves .
&quot; what happened to your le@@ g ? &quot; &quot; I was s@@ ki@@ ing and I fell . &quot;
Tom bought Mary a bir@@ th@@ day pres@@ ent .
I cannot b@@ ear the p@@ ain any more .
the man k@@ ept talking for an h@@ our .
I feel a great love for all of hu@@ man@@ ity .
Tom was really happy .
why are the po@@ lice here ?
we all tru@@ st you .
this watch is t@@ wi@@ ce as exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve as that one .
I &apos;ll take c@@ are of the dog while you are out .
I want to tell you that din@@ ner is ser@@ ved .
E@@ ro@@ s is the first a@@ st@@ er@@ o@@ id to be l@@ an@@ ded u@@ p@@ on by a sp@@ ac@@ ec@@ ra@@ ft .
Tom st@@ op@@ ped di@@ g@@ g@@ ing .
are you la@@ ugh@@ ing at me ?
you ought to know that .
I &apos;m not as hea@@ v@@ y as Tom .
have you ever heard of the L@@ o@@ ch N@@ ess mon@@ ster ?
tell me what it was like .
th@@ ank you for list@@ en@@ ing to me .
if you hear from J@@ en@@ n@@ y , could you tell her I would like to see her ?
Tom has hi@@ c@@ cu@@ ps .
my father bought me a watch , which I don &apos;t like very much .
we &apos;re con@@ fi@@ dent that you are up to the ch@@ al@@ l@@ en@@ ge of the new pos@@ it@@ ion .
the ga@@ p be@@ tw@@ e@@ en what can be i@@ ma@@ g@@ ined and what can be ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ed has never been sm@@ al@@ l@@ er .
Tom is quite often late for school .
I@@ n@@ c@@ it@@ em@@ ent to su@@ ic@@ i@@ de is a cri@@ me .
how to say this sen@@ t@@ ence in your language ?
Tom wasn &apos;t able to work last week .
this p@@ ac@@ k@@ ag@@ ing is hard to re@@ mo@@ ve .
would you give me a dis@@ coun@@ t ?
I want you to look for Tom .
this is the house where that po@@ et li@@ ved when he was a child .
the t@@ em@@ per@@ at@@ ure &apos;s f@@ al@@ l@@ en b@@ el@@ o@@ w z@@ er@@ o .
I don &apos;t know anyone who cor@@ resp@@ on@@ ds to that des@@ cri@@ p@@ tion .
it &apos;s no use wor@@ r@@ ying about it . there &apos;s nothing you can do .
j@@ eal@@ ou@@ sy is the un@@ du@@ e con@@ cer@@ n about the pre@@ ser@@ v@@ ation of that which can only be lost if not wor@@ th kee@@ ping .
E@@ th@@ ic@@ s is a br@@ an@@ ch of ph@@ il@@ os@@ op@@ h@@ y .
I do that for Tom .
I thought you said Tom was d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous .
how much did you p@@ ay to have your car re@@ pa@@ ir@@ ed ?
Tom is in the pri@@ me of his life .
I want to know why you &apos;re doing this .
did Tom say where Mary might be ?
he is not s@@ car@@ ed of s@@ na@@ kes at all .
this mo@@ vi@@ e has French su@@ b@@ t@@ it@@ les .
your de@@ cl@@ ar@@ ati@@ ons re@@ f@@ le@@ c@@ t your in@@ to@@ l@@ er@@ ance .
the la@@ w en@@ ab@@ les us to rec@@ ei@@ ve an an@@ nu@@ ity .
he had w@@ ished her happy ho@@ li@@ days .
the e@@ g@@ gs in this ca@@ se are f@@ re@@ s@@ her than those in the other ca@@ se .
did I for@@ get to m@@ en@@ tion that ?
we can &apos;t let Tom have that di@@ a@@ mon@@ d .
hu@@ m@@ ans ac@@ comp@@ lish a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing things , because they can ex@@ change in@@ for@@ mat@@ i@@ ons about their kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge and in@@ ten@@ ti@@ ons vi@@ a the me@@ di@@ u@@ m of language .
he &apos;s ei@@ ther c@@ raz@@ y or on d@@ ru@@ gs .
I made a li@@ st of the stud@@ ents &apos; na@@ mes in al@@ p@@ ha@@ be@@ ti@@ cal or@@ der .
I f@@ el@@ t resp@@ on@@ sible for Tom &apos;s ac@@ cident .
tell Tom that Mary doesn &apos;t want him to come over .
w@@ ear this co@@ at , or you will cat@@ ch a cold .
to un@@ su@@ b@@ s@@ cri@@ be , c@@ li@@ ck here .
with his col@@ or@@ ed clo@@ th@@ es , his long wi@@ g and his wh@@ ite g@@ lo@@ ves , one could gu@@ ess he has ru@@ n away from some kind of D@@ is@@ ne@@ y@@ land .
is it really possible to pre@@ dic@@ t an ear@@ th@@ qu@@ a@@ ke ?
he g@@ ro@@ ws v@@ e@@ get@@ ab@@ les in his gar@@ d@@ en .
Tom and Mary told John that they didn &apos;t think Alice was as@@ le@@ ep .
I have never al@@ lu@@ ded to mar@@ ri@@ age .
that sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have been al@@ low@@ ed .
you don &apos;t really me@@ an it , do you ?
Tom told Mary about last night &apos;s or@@ dea@@ l .
we have the same proble@@ ms as you .
yesterday I be@@ came a go@@ d , but found that a b@@ it bor@@ ing , so today I be@@ came a de@@ vi@@ l .
I want e@@ g@@ gs for brea@@ k@@ fast tomorrow morning .
I don &apos;t have any other op@@ tion .
she gave them some ap@@ pl@@ es .
he knows how to di@@ ve .
Tom couldn &apos;t see anything .
how did you be@@ come a po@@ lice off@@ ic@@ er ?
can &apos;t you just ask Tom to help us ?
where will she put them ?
he is ol@@ der than I by two years .
M@@ a@@ the@@ mat@@ ic@@ i@@ ans and s@@ ci@@ enti@@ st@@ s call a qu@@ an@@ t@@ ity which de@@ p@@ ends on di@@ rec@@ tion a v@@ ec@@ tor qu@@ an@@ t@@ ity . a qu@@ an@@ t@@ ity which does not de@@ p@@ end on di@@ rec@@ tion is called a s@@ cal@@ a@@ r qu@@ an@@ t@@ ity .
the con@@ f@@ er@@ ence was not a compl@@ e@@ te su@@ cc@@ ess .
let me change into something more ap@@ pro@@ pri@@ ate .
he &apos;s always g@@ os@@ si@@ ping .
is Tom ready ?
Tom wants to ask you some quest@@ i@@ ons about French .
this is something to im@@ it@@ ate !
something in@@ cre@@ di@@ ble happened .
Tom seem@@ ed to be h@@ es@@ it@@ ant to do that .
I ho@@ pe you &apos;re en@@ jo@@ ying your@@ sel@@ ves .

he had bought a dog .
L@@ a@@ ur@@ a is from B@@ raz@@ il . she is B@@ raz@@ i@@ li@@ an .

Tom is a mo@@ de@@ l in@@ m@@ ate .

is that not possible any@@ more ?
is she Japanese ?
Tom st@@ ep@@ ped back .

Tom pre@@ f@@ ers sta@@ ying home on M@@ on@@ days .
I don &apos;t think Tom and Mary are brother and sister .
Tom wa@@ ited ou@@ t@@ side in the p@@ our@@ ing rain for over an h@@ our .
my father has been out of work for a year .
do@@ gs can &apos;t di@@ st@@ in@@ gu@@ ish col@@ or@@ s .

she hel@@ ped the old man ac@@ r@@ os@@ s the stre@@ et .

Tom said he &apos;d only talk to you .
I &apos;d like to hear you sing .
most people think that people sh@@ ouldn &apos;t eat people .
what &apos;s your lea@@ st fav@@ or@@ ite food ?
Tom says he isn &apos;t afraid .
I b@@ el@@ ong to the k@@ ar@@ ate cl@@ u@@ b .
I think Mary looks better without ma@@ k@@ e@@ up .

Tom was here at that time .
Tom and Mary wal@@ ked out of the bu@@ il@@ ding in a hur@@ ry .
I want to get a di@@ v@@ or@@ ce .
Tom left the water on .
as far as I know , Tom and Mary have never done that .
Tom was par@@ tly right .

we have to do away with such a bad cu@@ st@@ om .

who b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ its from all of that ?
everyone did a f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous job .
he was one of the lea@@ d@@ ers of the re@@ v@@ ol@@ u@@ tion .
I need 3@@ 0 minu@@ tes .
Mary gre@@ e@@ ted her gu@@ est@@ s at the door .
I could not walk .
we wa@@ ited in the mo@@ vi@@ e th@@ ea@@ ter for the f@@ il@@ m to star@@ t .
Mary wanted to fin@@ ish ma@@ king brea@@ k@@ fast before Tom wo@@ ke up .
I &apos;m im@@ p@@ ati@@ ent .

you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t ac@@ t sel@@ f@@ ish@@ ly .
I &apos;ve been to ne@@ i@@ ther of those pl@@ ac@@ es .
she doesn &apos;t speak English .
un@@ i@@ for@@ ms diff@@ er from school to school .

Tom must be hun@@ g@@ ry .
I ho@@ pe she se@@ es this .

there is almost z@@ er@@ o fri@@ c@@ tion to ta@@ king the next st@@ ep .
I cannot pos@@ si@@ b@@ ly help you .

pla@@ ying mu@@ si@@ c to me is like reading a book .
Tom knows what you said .
my friends g@@ en@@ er@@ ally call me F@@ re@@ d@@ dy .
Tom re@@ ma@@ ined c@@ ool .
do as you think f@@ it .
watch what you &apos;re doing !
I &apos;m d@@ ying to know what &apos;s in@@ side .
Tom is waiting for Mary ou@@ t@@ side the mo@@ vi@@ e th@@ ea@@ ter .
if you don &apos;t keep your pro@@ mis@@ es , people won &apos;t take you ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ly .
Tom can &apos;t even play one s@@ ong on his u@@ k@@ ul@@ el@@ e without ma@@ king mista@@ kes .
Tom and Mary told John that they were teach@@ ers .
her name rin@@ gs a b@@ ell .
he cu@@ t off a br@@ an@@ ch from the t@@ ree .
I lost my s@@ un@@ gl@@ as@@ ses .
what did B@@ ra@@ in@@ less and U@@ n@@ happy do ?
Tom is un@@ dre@@ s@@ sing .
the reason why we have two ears and only one m@@ ou@@ th is so that we may listen more and talk less .
it isn &apos;t ob@@ vi@@ ous .
hur@@ ry up ! if you don &apos;t , we &apos;ll be late .
I haven &apos;t seen Tom in wee@@ ks .
my to@@ e beg@@ an to b@@ le@@ ed .
Tom is a ma@@ the@@ mat@@ ic@@ i@@ an .
if he doesn &apos;t ac@@ c@@ ept the job , some@@ body else will .
years ag@@ o , when Tom &apos;s children were young , he used to take a lot of pic@@ tu@@ res .
Tom often ea@@ ts fr@@ u@@ it for des@@ ser@@ t .
speak up , and speak c@@ lear@@ ly .
is that a boy or a girl ?
we have something else in comm@@ on .
the ju@@ g@@ gl@@ er wo@@ w@@ ed the c@@ row@@ d by kee@@ ping ten or@@ ang@@ es up in the a@@ ir .
I &apos;m doing well .
do you use all this stu@@ f@@ f ?
I see what you me@@ an .
do you know what I like ?
the con@@ f@@ er@@ ence is to be hel@@ d in T@@ o@@ k@@ y@@ o .
Mary is young , but she is not in@@ no@@ cent .
what is the language spo@@ ken in B@@ raz@@ il ?
I know di@@ r@@ ty jo@@ kes , but I never tell them .
I may not do that .
I &apos;d ra@@ ther you didn &apos;t , if you don &apos;t mind .
the su@@ it &apos;s made of very rough mat@@ er@@ i@@ al .
if you do that , you will be ch@@ ea@@ ting .
po@@ int to the one you me@@ an .
Tom came about 2 : 3@@ 0 .
it &apos;s un@@ li@@ k@@ ely that he did his ho@@ me@@ work himself .
she went about the hou@@ se@@ ho@@ ld cho@@ res .
nobody &apos;s hun@@ g@@ ry .
I &apos;m re@@ lea@@ sing the pri@@ s@@ on@@ ers .

Tom s@@ oun@@ ded ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sted .
if you are to su@@ cc@@ e@@ ed , you must work h@@ ar@@ der .
is there something in par@@ ti@@ cu@@ la@@ r that you want to hear ?
the tra@@ vel@@ er saw a light from a@@ far and re@@ jo@@ ic@@ ed .
how is it that you can speak this language ?
L@@ i@@ bu@@ s@@ z@@ a lives in P@@ o@@ z@@ na@@ ń .
b@@ ill turned on the tel@@ e@@ vis@@ ion .
he &apos;ll be here any mo@@ ment .
I ans@@ w@@ ered your quest@@ i@@ ons . now let me ask you a few .

I don &apos;t have time for a v@@ ac@@ ation this year .
the phone r@@ an@@ g , but I didn &apos;t answer .
I know that &apos;s not why you &apos;re here .
there are only ch@@ em@@ ic@@ als in that ma@@ y@@ o !

Tom was my first French teacher .
the only time he f@@ ee@@ ds the dog is when his wife is away on a tri@@ p .
you always said you wanted to learn French .
Tom fell as@@ le@@ ep right away .
I ad@@ m@@ it this may not be the best way of doing it .
in 1@@ 9@@ 0@@ 0 , he left Eng@@ land , and he never re@@ turned .
give me one reason why I sh@@ ouldn &apos;t do that .

com@@ pu@@ t@@ ers are con@@ stan@@ tly being im@@ pro@@ ved .
where &apos;s my family ?
you aren &apos;t al@@ low@@ ed in here .
if I had a cho@@ ice , I &apos;d go home now .

there are still some un@@ ans@@ w@@ ered quest@@ i@@ ons .
she asked me if I knew Tom &apos;s ad@@ dress .
he pro@@ mis@@ ed he &apos;d help us .
Tom left the room without sa@@ ying a word .
he made up the story .
I think you &apos;d better talk to her .
Tom doesn &apos;t look happy about it .
S@@ am@@ i was f@@ ree to do wh@@ at@@ ever he wanted to do .
Tom still some@@ times stu@@ di@@ es French .
you &apos;ve kno@@ wn Tom a lot lon@@ ger than I have .
Tom is stu@@ ck in j@@ a@@ il because he can &apos;t a@@ ff@@ or@@ d ba@@ il .
we &apos;re par@@ t@@ n@@ ers in cri@@ me .
all the young b@@ at@@ s were happy to be f@@ l@@ ying . they f@@ le@@ w around the la@@ ke and through the p@@ ine tre@@ es .
P@@ ar@@ don me for sa@@ ying so .
you can go wh@@ er@@ ever you want to go .
I wanted to read a book .
su@@ per@@ st@@ it@@ ion is the re@@ li@@ g@@ ion of f@@ ee@@ ble min@@ ds .
the po@@ li@@ ce@@ man said that it looked like a self @-@ in@@ f@@ li@@ c@@ ted g@@ un@@ sho@@ t w@@ ound to the hea@@ d .
Tom is c@@ lear@@ ing his th@@ ro@@ at .
I have not seen anything of E@@ li@@ z@@ a@@ be@@ th lat@@ ely .
he should have been here ten minu@@ tes ag@@ o .
it looks like everyone has left .
she &apos;s in@@ se@@ c@@ ure and has low self est@@ ee@@ m .
the ac@@ cu@@ sed th@@ i@@ e@@ f is on tri@@ al now .
he is watch@@ ing my every mo@@ ve .
he has a big house on the m@@ oun@@ tain .
love is str@@ ong , but money is str@@ on@@ ger .
Tom is up there waiting for you .
we wal@@ ked along the sh@@ ore of the la@@ ke .
Tom could come with me if he wants to .
he is bu@@ si@@ er than T@@ ar@@ o .
M@@ r@@ . K@@ o@@ i@@ z@@ u@@ m@@ i tal@@ ks en@@ d@@ le@@ s@@ s@@ ly without st@@ op@@ ping .

I have been to K@@ yo@@ to station to see my father off .
the th@@ i@@ e@@ f f@@ led without lea@@ ving any tr@@ ac@@ es .
that is your last ch@@ ance to take back what you said !
he r@@ an to@@ w@@ ard me as fast as he could .
Mary said she didn &apos;t have a dog .
Tom st@@ ep@@ ped for@@ w@@ ard to kis@@ s Mary , but she st@@ ep@@ ped back .
why does everything happ@@ en to me ?
don &apos;t eat the fr@@ u@@ it in the bo@@ w@@ l on the table . it &apos;s pla@@ st@@ ic .
I know ex@@ ac@@ tly what you &apos;re talking about .
what do you want to get Tom for Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as ?
first find out her name and ad@@ dress .
I was put to great in@@ con@@ ven@@ i@@ ence .
one thing ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t chang@@ ed .
when did he f@@ all ill ?
here she is !
I can a@@ ff@@ or@@ d good food now .
Tom wanted to learn how people in other coun@@ tri@@ es live .
how could you do this to Tom ?
T@@ i@@ gh@@ ten the s@@ cre@@ ws .
he will come this af@@ ter@@ no@@ on .
I am not a li@@ on but I too can ro@@ a@@ r .
that was true for Tom , too .
I am your ser@@ v@@ ant .
he is always ch@@ e@@ er@@ ful .
you should always turn off the light when you leave a room . this can sa@@ ve a lot of en@@ er@@ g@@ y .
he st@@ op@@ ped talking .
Tom wants to be a la@@ w@@ y@@ er .
he &apos;s a gr@@ ou@@ ch .
I &apos;ve never heard that before .
I don &apos;t know why you &apos;re here .
I really do mis@@ s my parents a lot .
he put his c@@ oo@@ king ap@@ r@@ on on in or@@ der to a@@ vo@@ id getting his ju@@ m@@ p@@ er di@@ r@@ ty with gre@@ as@@ y sta@@ ins .
we love this school .

I &apos;m really looking for@@ w@@ ard to t@@ on@@ ight &apos;s con@@ cer@@ t .
don &apos;t wor@@ ry , Tom . it &apos;s nothing to be al@@ ar@@ med about .
every time I read the B@@ i@@ ble , I am de@@ e@@ pl@@ y mo@@ ved .

I &apos;m not inv@@ ited to par@@ ti@@ es .
father la@@ id his h@@ and on my sh@@ oul@@ der .
this me@@ dic@@ ine does not ag@@ ree with me .
our life ab@@ so@@ lu@@ t@@ ely chang@@ ed in Boston .
Tom re@@ fu@@ sed to p@@ ay the b@@ ill .
Tom knows that Mary doesn &apos;t speak French .
the hear@@ t is lo@@ c@@ ated in the ch@@ est .
I gu@@ ess you &apos;ve been to Boston before .
he asked me if I &apos;d help him .
why doesn &apos;t he tell me jo@@ kes any@@ more ?
Tom is the hea@@ d s@@ ci@@ enti@@ st .
when did you first me@@ et Tom ?
it &apos;s a good po@@ li@@ c@@ y .
he ang@@ r@@ il@@ y cl@@ os@@ ed the door .
this old bu@@ il@@ ding isn &apos;t wor@@ th fi@@ x@@ ing up . it would be better to t@@ ear it down .
you can hi@@ re a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle by the h@@ our at this sho@@ p .
Tom s@@ n@@ app@@ ed out of his re@@ ver@@ i@@ e .
Tom has lost the will to live .
he knows the c@@ ity well .
she c@@ oo@@ ks for him .
be a man .
come on , tell him !
this is the v@@ il@@ l@@ age where he was bor@@ n .
I don &apos;t like mat@@ h , much less ph@@ y@@ si@@ c@@ s .

my father is p@@ r@@ ou@@ d of me being t@@ all and h@@ and@@ some .
have you ever been there ?
Tom started ta@@ king bo@@ x@@ ing le@@ s@@ s@@ ons when he turned tw@@ el@@ ve .
his wife has him un@@ der the th@@ u@@ m@@ b .

he always tal@@ ks as if he knows everything .
Tom du@@ m@@ ped me .
I usu@@ ally go to the b@@ ar@@ b@@ er once a mon@@ th .
I didn &apos;t even know you had a bo@@ y@@ friend .
a pen@@ n@@ y sa@@ ved is a pen@@ n@@ y ear@@ ned .
you are exp@@ ec@@ ted to p@@ ass the ex@@ am .
I am not gu@@ il@@ ty !
I drea@@ m of going to L@@ i@@ th@@ u@@ an@@ i@@ a and li@@ ving there .
they called the dog C@@ oo@@ ki@@ e .
Tom called me at home .
she wants to talk to you .
if it were not for your ad@@ vi@@ ce , I would be at a l@@ os@@ s .
what I have to tell you is very im@@ port@@ ant .
are you sure you don &apos;t want me to help you out ?
Tom is from a ri@@ ch Boston family .
do you have bro@@ thers and si@@ st@@ ers ?
I don &apos;t ne@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ar@@ il@@ y ag@@ ree with everything I say .
you know where Tom is , don &apos;t you ?
please stop la@@ ugh@@ ing .
she is an@@ x@@ i@@ ous about your heal@@ th .
can you i@@ d@@ enti@@ f@@ y the cause of the problem ?
when Tom fin@@ ally deci@@ ded to come out of the cl@@ os@@ et , everyone already knew he was g@@ ay .
he r@@ ar@@ ely went there .
I didn &apos;t sh@@ oo@@ t anyone .
you won &apos;t believe what happened to me today .
Tom doesn &apos;t know French .
Tom c@@ ra@@ w@@ led out from un@@ der the table .
what am I sup@@ pos@@ ed to eat ?
the man was@@ h@@ ing the car is M@@ r@@ . J@@ on@@ es .
Tom has been to Boston a nu@@ mber of times .
Australia is the lar@@ ge@@ st country in the world without bor@@ d@@ ers with any other country .
I didn &apos;t understand anything , ei@@ ther .
I love him .@@ .@@ . I think .
Tom looked around the room .
where did Tom go ?
my li@@ gh@@ ts are on fu@@ ll bea@@ m .
you can get it at any boo@@ k@@ sel@@ l@@ er &apos;s .
Tom sp@@ ent thir@@ ty years in pri@@ son .
if I w@@ er@@ en &apos;t broke , I &apos;d buy it .
I don &apos;t want to dea@@ l with this problem now .
is there s@@ al@@ t left ?
I did what I could . it &apos;s your turn now .
a l@@ ou@@ d kno@@ c@@ king at the door wo@@ ke him up .
are you a stu@@ dent ?
what if we get ca@@ ught ?
I can &apos;t ex@@ pl@@ ain anything .
Tom took a picture of himself f@@ le@@ x@@ ing his ab@@ s in fr@@ on@@ t of the m@@ ir@@ r@@ or .
F@@ an@@ t@@ as@@ y is often the mother of ar@@ t .
the gar@@ d@@ en is really a si@@ ght for s@@ ore ey@@ es .
Tom didn &apos;t do much work today .
I like f@@ ish better than me@@ at .
Tom made no@@ i@@ se .
it &apos;s really time something was done .
we often pla@@ yed house in the par@@ k .
have you ever tra@@ vel@@ ed by a@@ ir ?
how often do you take a sho@@ wer ?
so many ta@@ st@@ y f@@ oo@@ ds can be pre@@ par@@ ed with e@@ g@@ g@@ plan@@ ts !
how many su@@ ic@@ i@@ d@@ es do you think there are every year in Japan ?
you &apos;ll be more com@@ for@@ table in this room .
Tom is lo@@ ving .
I ac@@ ted in ac@@ cor@@ d@@ ance with my own con@@ v@@ ic@@ tion .
he need not give up the plan .
say it in German .
I &apos;m not used to this .
don &apos;t bo@@ a@@ st too much about that .
f@@ re@@ sh @-@ water f@@ ish in@@ cl@@ u@@ de some de@@ si@@ g@@ n@@ ated as pro@@ t@@ ec@@ ted sp@@ ec@@ ies . you &apos;re not al@@ low@@ ed to cat@@ ch or buy them .
as soon as he arrived at the a@@ ir@@ por@@ t , he ph@@ on@@ ed his off@@ ice .
I &apos;m afraid the l@@ ine is busy .
I didn &apos;t read it all .
don &apos;t be so p@@ r@@ ou@@ d of your di@@ pl@@ o@@ m@@ a
there &apos;s a s@@ ha@@ g car@@ p@@ et in the li@@ ving room .
the train will come in at pl@@ at@@ for@@ m ten .
Tom is ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly in@@ f@@ at@@ u@@ ated with Mary .
you &apos;re a sh@@ ar@@ p one .
a s@@ no@@ w@@ f@@ la@@ ke l@@ an@@ ded on the ti@@ p of Mary &apos;s n@@ ose .
Tom will be able to swi@@ m soon .
I &apos;m sure that was her .
well , then , if you want me to I &apos;ll do it .
he &apos;s a l@@ and@@ lu@@ b@@ b@@ er .
she &apos;s w@@ ear@@ ing s@@ un@@ gl@@ as@@ ses .
Tom told me not to open that door .
you were cor@@ rec@@ t .
she ex@@ pla@@ ined the reason why she was late .
Tom and Mary told John that they thought Alice was in@@ no@@ cent .
she &apos;s only two years old , but she can already coun@@ t to 1@@ 0@@ 0 .
what do you want them to do ?
please keep this money for me .
she had no ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tion .
I need an answer now .
I &apos;d ra@@ ther di@@ e than sur@@ ren@@ der .
Alice will tell you that in W@@ on@@ der@@ land everything is to@@ p@@ sy @-@ tur@@ v@@ y .
Tom didn &apos;t want to go there alone .
give me the car k@@ ey , please .
you can &apos;t h@@ and@@ le it .
I will no@@ ti@@ f@@ y Tom .
the im@@ mi@@ gr@@ an@@ ts drea@@ m of ha@@ ving a new , better life .
let &apos;s get started .
the only reason Tom went to the party was that he exp@@ ec@@ ted Mary to be there .
I &apos;m sure Tom and Mary don &apos;t want to be the on@@ es resp@@ on@@ sible for doing that .
why do you need to read such a book ?
Tom ! br@@ ing me a s@@ and@@ wi@@ ch .
what is the prob@@ ab@@ i@@ li@@ ty that at lea@@ st two stud@@ ents have the same bir@@ th@@ day ?
P@@ fir@@ si@@ ch@@ ba@@ e@@ u@@ m@@ ch@@ en is from Ger@@ many .
I don &apos;t like f@@ il@@ ter coffee .
please just leave me alone . I want to think .
I need tw@@ en@@ ty @-@ f@@ our hours .
I &apos;ve always wanted to go to an@@ other country .
they make me la@@ u@@ gh .
the p@@ en is mi@@ gh@@ ti@@ er than the s@@ word .
I wanted to buy the book .
Tom left fi@@ ve minu@@ tes early .
I &apos;d like you to me@@ et my son .
I can tell when you &apos;re l@@ ying .
it has been ra@@ in@@ ing on and off since this morning .
she was right and he was wrong .
wh@@ at@@ ever happ@@ en@@ s happ@@ en@@ s .
aren &apos;t you list@@ en@@ ing ?
Tom and Mary are now di@@ v@@ or@@ ced .
you have to take off your sho@@ es before en@@ ter@@ ing a tr@@ ad@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al Japanese house .
Tom was often late for school .
br@@ ing your children along .
I &apos;ll never do anything by h@@ al@@ ves .
Tom &apos;s got an an@@ al@@ y@@ ti@@ cal mind .
he won many com@@ pe@@ t@@ it@@ i@@ ons .
it &apos;s pret@@ ty u@@ g@@ ly .
if you had left a little ear@@ li@@ er , you would have a@@ vo@@ i@@ ded the hea@@ v@@ y tra@@ ff@@ ic .
the c@@ at is drin@@ king .
would you like to go for a walk ?
I want to know more about Tom &apos;s bi@@ o@@ lo@@ gi@@ cal parents .
I like to play so@@ cc@@ er .
the station is to the w@@ est of the ho@@ te@@ l .
her ac@@ tion des@@ er@@ ves resp@@ ect .
Tom said Mary may do that .
I can &apos;t get that out of my mind .
they call R@@ ob@@ er@@ t &quot; B@@ o@@ b . &quot;
we want to see the king .
can I try this on ?

Tom wor@@ ks for an I@@ tal@@ i@@ an comp@@ any .
I need a lea@@ ther j@@ ac@@ k@@ et .
I don &apos;t in@@ t@@ end to do what Tom told me to do .
English is a sister language of German .
we can &apos;t even be cer@@ tain that it was Tom &apos;s vo@@ ice we heard .
I want to hear it again .
life is d@@ ear to everybody .
why was I never told about this ?
this bo@@ x w@@ ei@@ gh@@ s a ton . what &apos;s in@@ side ?
why don &apos;t you s@@ it down and re@@ la@@ x ?
you des@@ er@@ ve to su@@ cc@@ e@@ ed .
I &apos;m sa@@ ving up to buy a new car .
what was the first in@@ st@@ ru@@ ment you lear@@ ned to play ?
s@@ mo@@ king is the ma@@ j@@ or cause of l@@ un@@ g can@@ c@@ er .
there are about 3@@ .@@ 4 mil@@ li@@ on mil@@ li@@ on@@ a@@ i@@ res in the U@@ n@@ ited S@@ t@@ at@@ es .
what do you want to do with your life ?
Tom &apos;s al@@ co@@ ho@@ li@@ c father often be@@ at him up .
Tom prob@@ ab@@ ly doesn &apos;t know wh@@ e@@ ther he nee@@ ds to do that or not .
talking to Tom is like talking to a b@@ ri@@ ck w@@ all .
Tom has re@@ j@@ ec@@ ted our off@@ er .
where are you going this af@@ ter@@ no@@ on ?
yesterday was the first day of a@@ u@@ tu@@ m@@ n .
I got here as fast as I could .
everything you have will have you some@@ day .
nobody lo@@ ves me .
even at that early age the other children could prob@@ ab@@ ly tell there was something wrong , de@@ sp@@ ite the f@@ ac@@ t that I never su@@ sp@@ ec@@ ted anything of the sor@@ t ; and this was to be the ca@@ se for a long time to come .
B@@ ei@@ j@@ ing is chang@@ ing so r@@ ap@@ i@@ d@@ ly .
we dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sed what to do .
Tom was afraid that Mary would say no .
U@@ n@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , it ra@@ ined yesterday .
I thought Tom li@@ ved in Boston .
our c@@ ity is f@@ ree from a@@ ir po@@ l@@ lu@@ tion .
the ma@@ ch@@ ine again made the usu@@ al no@@ i@@ se and p@@ rin@@ ted out the fol@@ low@@ ing an@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is .
she was a z@@ eal@@ ous wor@@ k@@ er for ch@@ ar@@ ity .
my dress doesn &apos;t f@@ it any@@ more !
why are you so n@@ ice to everyone ?
the thought of not ri@@ s@@ king something fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ s me to death .
a pre@@ si@@ dent is like a ce@@ me@@ ter@@ y man@@ ag@@ er . he has a lot of people un@@ der him , but no one list@@ en@@ s .
it &apos;s all G@@ re@@ e@@ k to me .
what you call love is nothing more than just at@@ tr@@ ac@@ tion .
does this bu@@ s go to the train station ?
I &apos;m con@@ v@@ in@@ ced that my son is in@@ no@@ cent .
Tom sta@@ yed at home .
sh@@ all I call K@@ en back ?
I love my ti@@ ger du@@ ck . he is qu@@ i@@ et , but lo@@ y@@ al .
I need a mo@@ ment alone with Tom .
I think you &apos;ve been li@@ ed to .
by wh@@ om was the comp@@ any f@@ oun@@ ded ?
&quot; are these your boo@@ ks ? &quot; &quot; no , they &apos;re not m@@ ine . &quot;

I just got pro@@ m@@ ot@@ ed .
Tom s@@ la@@ m@@ med the door be@@ h@@ ind him .
the p@@ ain was such that I was not able to sleep .
I don &apos;t think Tom is a bad boy .
the po@@ int is that they are hun@@ g@@ ry .
I think it &apos;s going to rain .
the do@@ gs b@@ ar@@ ked all night .
what &apos;s that you &apos;re wor@@ king on ?
what are you doing t@@ on@@ ight ?

Tom asked for a ra@@ i@@ se .
a fi@@ er@@ ce b@@ at@@ t@@ le was f@@ ought by the sol@@ di@@ ers .
L@@ on@@ e@@ some G@@ e@@ or@@ ge , the last re@@ ma@@ in@@ ing t@@ or@@ to@@ i@@ se of his kind , died of un@@ kno@@ wn ca@@ u@@ ses .
we are at home today .
you know him better than I do .
I didn &apos;t buy that car .

Tom and Mary were s@@ it@@ ting on the so@@ f@@ a very cl@@ ose to each other .
there &apos;s no sen@@ t@@ ence with # 2@@ 6@@ 4@@ 4@@ 0@@ 5 .

it was a very good ex@@ per@@ i@@ ence for him .
Tom got bor@@ ed after fi@@ f@@ te@@ en minu@@ tes .
I d@@ ou@@ b@@ t if this sho@@ p will ever p@@ ay its way .
no hu@@ man po@@ wer can man@@ age that .
K@@ yo@@ k@@ o is l@@ ying on the gr@@ ass .
you must be back on S@@ un@@ day at the lat@@ est .
Tom ho@@ ped the rain would stop before he had to walk home .
my father died when I was se@@ ven .

everybody has their fav@@ or@@ ite drink .

today &apos;s wea@@ ther fore@@ ca@@ st pro@@ ved right .
she is a good dea@@ l ol@@ der than he .
you &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding too much time wor@@ r@@ ying .
do you really think money will br@@ ing you happ@@ in@@ ess ?
who looks after the children ?
Tom was looking for something to eat .
you have an e @-@ ma@@ il me@@ s@@ sa@@ ge in your in@@ bo@@ x .
she was really s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed .
don &apos;t mind if I do !
Mary speaks with Tom &apos;s mother every day .
Tom is with her .
Tom and Mary wanted to be left alone .
this room is well f@@ ur@@ n@@ ished .
she looked out of the windo@@ w .
what &apos;s happened ?
Tom wal@@ ked ac@@ r@@ os@@ s the stre@@ et .
they aren &apos;t alone .
his re@@ el@@ ec@@ tion seems sure .
she came into the room .
before you leave home , make sure your pe@@ ts have enough food .

&quot; really ? &quot; &quot; Y@@ es , really . &quot;
I think it &apos;s better you stay here unti@@ l the s@@ now st@@ op@@ s .
I don &apos;t have a son na@@ med Tom .
O@@ K , I understand .
he is a very la@@ z@@ y boy .
it is d@@ ar@@ k in that room .
I gave Tom no cho@@ ice .
what &apos;ll Tom do tomorrow ?
I &apos;ve always f@@ ed my do@@ gs in the early e@@ ven@@ ing .
in the next f@@ our years , 1@@ 5 b@@ il@@ li@@ on e@@ u@@ ro@@ s must be sa@@ ved .

aren &apos;t you as@@ ha@@ med of yourself ?
you must not eat anything for a few days .
you have to cre@@ ate proble@@ ms to cre@@ ate pro@@ f@@ it .

Tom tra@@ vel@@ s a lot .
Tom saw a ho@@ m@@ el@@ ess man s@@ ca@@ ven@@ g@@ ing through a ru@@ b@@ b@@ ish b@@ in looking for food .
give p@@ ea@@ ce a ch@@ ance .
Tom won &apos;t li@@ k@@ ely feel like doing that .
take that bo@@ x away !
Tom died from a d@@ ru@@ g o@@ ver@@ d@@ ose .
there are many low @-@ c@@ ost a@@ ir@@ l@@ in@@ es in E@@ u@@ ro@@ pe .
was it really that bad ?
I only have 2@@ 4 hours left to deci@@ de .
I do all the work .
there was s@@ car@@ c@@ ely any money left .
I &apos;ve never seen Tom so ang@@ ry .
I don &apos;t know what else Tom told you , but I do know he doesn &apos;t always tell the tru@@ th .

Tom was in@@ s@@ an@@ e .
we don &apos;t know yet if he really broke his le@@ g . they &apos;ll do an X @-@ r@@ ay of it .
W@@ en@@ j@@ in is a Ch@@ in@@ ese woman .
Tom and Mary said they w@@ er@@ en &apos;t per@@ m@@ it@@ ted to do that any@@ more .
I got up very early this morning .

if he knew that he had won the lo@@ t@@ ter@@ y , he would &apos;ve called me st@@ ra@@ ight away .
what the h@@ ell is a se@@ mi@@ col@@ on for any@@ way ?
her man@@ n@@ ers are not those of a la@@ dy .
I like the old car more than the new .
you say that you want to stu@@ dy well , but don &apos;t ac@@ tu@@ ally work when it com@@ es to doing the ho@@ me@@ work . do you think that that &apos;s o@@ k@@ ay ?
you are to do your ho@@ me@@ work before sup@@ p@@ er .
Tom was par@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed by a st@@ ro@@ ke .

you &apos;re ne@@ g@@ li@@ g@@ ent .
K@@ o@@ bo@@ l@@ ds can only be seen on mo@@ on@@ less ni@@ gh@@ ts .

Tom is never going to let you go to Boston with Mary .
Tom said he didn &apos;t know why Mary was ang@@ ry .
would you mind not doing that ?

I th@@ ank you very much for your help .

don &apos;t re@@ pe@@ at that .
that was not my fa@@ ul@@ t .
did you ever fi@@ g@@ ure out how to do that ?

this is a time of year when people get together with family and friends to ob@@ ser@@ ve P@@ as@@ so@@ ver and to c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ate E@@ a@@ ster .
I ca@@ ught Tom looking into the ne@@ i@@ gh@@ bor@@ s &apos; windo@@ ws .
a@@ ir is com@@ pos@@ ed ma@@ in@@ ly of n@@ it@@ ro@@ g@@ en and o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en .

Mary is a pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al d@@ an@@ c@@ er .
people have sh@@ or@@ t me@@ mor@@ ies .

Tom sp@@ ent the day la@@ z@@ ing on the b@@ each .
&quot; I asked Tom if he had ever kis@@ sed a girl . &quot; &quot; and what did he say ? &quot;
two sh@@ ee@@ ts were on the bed .
Tom and Mary wor@@ ried about their children .
they say that he will never re@@ turn .
I just want to hu@@ g you .
this is where Tom used to s@@ it .
you &apos;ve done it again .
I don &apos;t understand D@@ u@@ t@@ ch . it &apos;s diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t .

who doesn &apos;t want to look young and se@@ x@@ y ?
I know you can &apos;t speak French .
he was in good sp@@ ir@@ its .
do you believe that there &apos;s life after death ?
the t@@ ree was f@@ el@@ led with one hard b@@ low of his a@@ x .
there is no one who doesn &apos;t de@@ si@@ re p@@ ea@@ ce .
the pre@@ si@@ dent of the re@@ pu@@ b@@ li@@ c is ch@@ os@@ en by the people .

that story b@@ rin@@ gs to mind the person I met in N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k .
I know that Tom is a very sh@@ y boy .
this ph@@ r@@ as@@ e@@ book is very u@@ se@@ ful to me .
he says he &apos;ll come .
most people around here have no el@@ ec@@ tri@@ c@@ ity .
Tom and Mary tal@@ ked on the phone almost every night .
Tom is con@@ si@@ der@@ ate .
every fo@@ x p@@ ra@@ is@@ es its ta@@ il .
why do you know that ?
I &apos;ll ex@@ pl@@ ain the matter to you lat@@ er on .
I li@@ ved in a small to@@ wn .
e@@ ven@@ ing dress is de@@ si@@ red .
did you d@@ ra@@ w this yourself ?
my gr@@ and@@ father is li@@ ving on a pen@@ sion .
I &apos;m sure people would live t@@ wi@@ ce as long if they st@@ op@@ ped getting the@@ m@@ sel@@ ves wor@@ ked up over everything .
she &apos;s a sho@@ p@@ ping ad@@ dic@@ t .
we don &apos;t know each other .
you won &apos;t re@@ gre@@ t it .
those an@@ im@@ als were in d@@ ang@@ er of d@@ ying out .
I can do it by my@@ self .
Tom com@@ pla@@ ined that his sto@@ ma@@ ch hur@@ t .
I &apos;m very wor@@ ried about your heal@@ th .
you &apos;ll get it some@@ day .
Tom is Mary &apos;s t@@ y@@ pe .
do not wor@@ ry about that !
give me the ar@@ row .
we &apos;re not happy with this .
that girl has quite a re@@ pu@@ t@@ ation .
do you want to come in@@ side ?
please pro@@ mi@@ se me that you will never tell a li@@ e again .
father &apos;s hair has turned gr@@ ay .
Tom isn &apos;t good at c@@ oo@@ king .
I took him as@@ i@@ de .
that &apos;s what you don &apos;t get .
Tom is still in Australia , isn &apos;t he ?
we want to speak with Tom .
I don &apos;t feel like going out .
I have something else I want you to do for me .
Tom almost never com@@ pla@@ ins about anything .
I &apos;m looking for@@ w@@ ard to su@@ mm@@ er v@@ ac@@ ation .
I op@@ ened the do@@ or@@ s .
Tom hel@@ ped Mary mo@@ ve the f@@ ur@@ n@@ it@@ ure .
what were they doing there ?
this dic@@ ti@@ on@@ ary has sen@@ ten@@ ces that il@@ lu@@ str@@ ate how to use each word .
your face is p@@ al@@ e .
I &apos;ll be back home to@@ w@@ ard the end of the mon@@ th .
Tom is never in his off@@ ice in the af@@ ter@@ no@@ on .
he des@@ er@@ ves a pro@@ mo@@ tion .
I didn &apos;t exp@@ ect Mary to re@@ ac@@ t like she did .
we were un@@ sure what kind of person Tom would be and wh@@ e@@ ther he would like to live in the same house as us .
he was ang@@ ry with his stud@@ ents .
what did she buy at that st@@ ore ?
my name is S@@ h@@ u .
I didn &apos;t me@@ an to u@@ p@@ s@@ et you .
we have a lot to con@@ si@@ der .
Tom is the only person who knows about this .
you cannot have your way in everything .
i@@ ma@@ g@@ ine that you beg@@ in to hi@@ cc@@ up and can &apos;t stop .
let &apos;s try to sol@@ ve the ri@@ dd@@ le .
she t@@ ends not to s@@ how her fe@@ el@@ in@@ gs .
Tom came by himself .
I don &apos;t want to see you again .
don &apos;t stop .
if you ha@@ dn &apos;t done it , some@@ one else would have .
I &apos;m compl@@ et@@ ely na@@ ked .
the u@@ ne@@ m@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ ment r@@ ate in Japan was 3@@ .@@ 4 per@@ cent in S@@ ep@@ te@@ mber of 2@@ 0@@ 1@@ 5 .
it ma@@ kes me n@@ er@@ v@@ ous .
Tom said he wanted to go .
F@@ or@@ ks go to the left side of the pl@@ ate , and k@@ ni@@ ves go to the right .
I want nothing to do with it .
I thought Tom would ag@@ ree with me .
you know it doesn &apos;t matter .
John called for the wa@@ it@@ er in a l@@ ou@@ d vo@@ ice .
we &apos;re ready to leave .
I often use S@@ S@@ H to ac@@ c@@ ess my com@@ pu@@ t@@ ers re@@ m@@ ot@@ ely .
even th@@ ough Tom left home early today , he was late for work .
he was shi@@ ver@@ ing from the cold .
were you at school at that time ?
Tom says he has never tried ea@@ ting wh@@ al@@ e me@@ at .
J@@ an@@ u@@ ary , F@@ e@@ b@@ ru@@ ary , M@@ ar@@ ch , A@@ pri@@ l , M@@ ay , J@@ un@@ e , J@@ u@@ ly , Au@@ gu@@ st , S@@ ep@@ te@@ mber , O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er , N@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ mber , D@@ ec@@ e@@ mber .
there &apos;s a h@@ os@@ ep@@ i@@ pe b@@ an this su@@ mm@@ er .
why do they do it ?
it &apos;s usu@@ ally a good thing .
Tom and I both want you to be happy .
we &apos;re ta@@ king off .
we made friends with J@@ an@@ e .
she ad@@ vis@@ ed him to go to the po@@ lice .
he dre@@ s@@ sed like a girl .
how do you inter@@ pre@@ t this po@@ em ?
how do you think it &apos;ll go ?
do you have a Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as t@@ ree ?
Tom and Mary were alone in the par@@ k .
who gave you this ?
we want to talk to you about a problem .
she likes min@@ is@@ k@@ ir@@ ts .
you speak R@@ u@@ s@@ si@@ an , don &apos;t you ?
Mary was mo@@ ved by the mu@@ si@@ c .
she doesn &apos;t se@@ em to know what to do with her le@@ is@@ ure time .
you could learn a few things from her .
she asked him to leave and take all his b@@ el@@ on@@ g@@ in@@ gs .
F@@ re@@ e@@ d@@ om is a@@ k@@ in to the r@@ ar@@ i@@ fi@@ ed a@@ ir of a m@@ oun@@ tain to@@ p . wea@@ k men cannot b@@ ear one or the other .

who am I ? I want to give you a small ti@@ p . I &apos;m not like other gir@@ ls . I &apos;m a little b@@ it differ@@ ent !
Tom has deci@@ ded to get married .
keep an ey@@ e on Tom .
small p@@ ot@@ s have long h@@ and@@ les .
I don &apos;t want Tom to help you do that .
this de@@ p@@ ends on you .
he could sm@@ ell her per@@ fu@@ me .
how did a to@@ ta@@ l str@@ ang@@ er know his name ?
that &apos;s really an@@ no@@ ying .
I in@@ t@@ ro@@ du@@ ced her to you last week .
Tom has to do this .
I want to be a teacher when I g@@ row up .
don &apos;t br@@ ing that di@@ r@@ ty dog through the k@@ it@@ ch@@ en .
why would you want to be a teacher ?
I get along well with all the sta@@ f@@ f .

Tom &apos;s father is a K@@ o@@ re@@ an W@@ a@@ r v@@ e@@ ter@@ an .

why is L@@ at@@ in im@@ port@@ ant for the life of a person ?
she gave up s@@ mo@@ king .

Tom knows that we know .

what were Tom and Mary sup@@ pos@@ ed to do ?
come on , g@@ row up .
you have no right to inter@@ f@@ ere in other people &apos;s af@@ fa@@ ir@@ s .
it &apos;s a s@@ qu@@ ir@@ re@@ l .
I had never seen so many s@@ qu@@ ir@@ re@@ ls in my life .
his fa@@ il@@ ure has nothing to do with me .
where the h@@ ell are you going ?
have you ever kis@@ sed a boy before ?
I was s@@ k@@ ep@@ ti@@ cal .
did you and Tom dis@@ cu@@ ss a pri@@ ce ?

Y@@ o@@ d@@ a , the wi@@ se J@@ e@@ d@@ i ma@@ ster , first app@@ ear@@ ed in the s@@ wa@@ m@@ p as a c@@ raz@@ y f@@ ro@@ g .
Tom doesn &apos;t even know Mary .

my r@@ oo@@ mm@@ ate is lear@@ ning Ch@@ in@@ ese .

I want to be as ri@@ ch as Tom .

I think you &apos;re right .
I like s@@ k@@ at@@ ing better .
I want something with which to write .
they fell and broke their le@@ gs .
for all his fa@@ ul@@ ts , I like him .
no matter how hard you try , you won &apos;t be able to do it .
why did the ch@@ ic@@ ken cr@@ os@@ s the road ?
Tom chang@@ ed his job .

when I came home , she was watch@@ ing T@@ V .
Tom is ti@@ d@@ ying his room .
why sen@@ ten@@ ces ? .@@ .@@ . you may ask . well , because sen@@ ten@@ ces are more interest@@ ing .
fol@@ low my ad@@ vi@@ ce .
why are you lo@@ c@@ king the door ?

B@@ o@@ il one e@@ g@@ g .
you can call me any time .
he is his teach@@ ers &apos; de@@ sp@@ a@@ ir .
I looked around , but saw nobody .
who w@@ ro@@ te this book ?
Tom asked me if I were hun@@ g@@ ry .
Tom is con@@ v@@ in@@ ced that he once li@@ ved as a s@@ qu@@ ir@@ re@@ l in a pa@@ st life .
John is my best friend .
I &apos;ll take Tom .
he said he would write to me , but he ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t .

he was ne@@ ar@@ ing his end .

one minu@@ te has si@@ x@@ ty se@@ con@@ ds .
even the b@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ st stu@@ dent couldn &apos;t sol@@ ve the problem .
Tom didn &apos;t help .
I tried to per@@ su@@ a@@ de him , but in v@@ ain .
it seems that nobody ta@@ kes any no@@ ti@@ ce of his op@@ in@@ i@@ ons .
he had a ter@@ ri@@ ble drea@@ m that night .

Tom has left .
the door will not open .

Tom doesn &apos;t know what Mary wants to eat for din@@ ner .

I bought a book .
please f@@ ill this bu@@ ck@@ et with water .
there &apos;s something I &apos;ve wanted to say to you for a long time .
you need not f@@ ear , because the go@@ d they are talking about does not ex@@ i@@ st , and if they tell you that it does , they are ei@@ ther wrong or they are u@@ sing the word &quot; ex@@ i@@ st &quot; with a differ@@ ent me@@ an@@ ing and th@@ us are just ma@@ king a st@@ at@@ em@@ ent about the@@ m@@ sel@@ ves .

Tom and Mary told John that they didn &apos;t think Alice was happy .
I can &apos;t tell you how sor@@ ry I am .
I didn &apos;t arri@@ ve unti@@ l it was too late .
after k@@ il@@ ling Tom , Mary bu@@ ried him in a sh@@ al@@ low gra@@ ve .

I want to know more about you , Tom .
the first thing Tom does when he me@@ e@@ ts a new woman is ch@@ ec@@ k to see if she &apos;s w@@ ear@@ ing a we@@ d@@ ding r@@ ing .
what about this one ?
a li@@ on was s@@ ent to k@@ ill H@@ er@@ cu@@ les .
Mary didn &apos;t se@@ em to understand why she had to do that .
I &apos;m sa@@ ving the best for last .
no language is as lo@@ v@@ ely as Japanese .
the D@@ an@@ ish person tri@@ es to speak I@@ tal@@ i@@ an at the beg@@ in@@ ning of the con@@ ver@@ s@@ ation .

I am fol@@ low@@ ing that car .
he in@@ t@@ ro@@ du@@ ced you to me , don &apos;t you remember ?
he &apos;s very se@@ x@@ y .
Tom couldn &apos;t have done it without Mary .
why does Mary c@@ ry so much ?
Tom lives in a house without r@@ un@@ ning water .
D@@ am@@ ned !
my sister has been married for three years .
would you like me to help you do that ?
was the teacher young ?
things happened very qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
Tom didn &apos;t sleep .
it wasn &apos;t plan@@ ned .
we haven &apos;t even dis@@ cu@@ s@@ sed that .
did Tom do this to you ?
we didn &apos;t know on which train they &apos;d be coming .
I am g@@ la@@ d you are here .
Tom can play the f@@ lu@@ te .
I &apos;ll see what I can do , but I don &apos;t pro@@ mi@@ se you anything .
Tom didn &apos;t remember where he &apos;d par@@ ked his car .
they say that he is ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ly ill .
don &apos;t wor@@ ry about the b@@ ab@@ y .

Mary pl@@ ac@@ ed her b@@ ab@@ y in a car se@@ at for the f@@ light .
bir@@ ds were sin@@ g@@ ing am@@ ong the tre@@ es .
Tom said that he was too busy to eat .
I just mo@@ ved in .
S@@ im@@ in@@ a sp@@ ends a lot of money on ci@@ gar@@ e@@ tt@@ es .

Tom arrived early .
sor@@ ry , I won &apos;t do it without a ru@@ b@@ b@@ er .
Tom or@@ der@@ ed a be@@ er .

I don &apos;t want to ar@@ gu@@ e about that .
Tom ha@@ tes o@@ per@@ a .

Tom s@@ la@@ m@@ med on the b@@ ra@@ kes .
this sho@@ p is open from 9@@ am to 6@@ p@@ m .

why would I do that ?
after Mary saw a s@@ qu@@ ir@@ re@@ l for the first time , she was very exc@@ ited and dre@@ w many pic@@ tu@@ res of s@@ qu@@ ir@@ re@@ ls .
my life would be me@@ an@@ in@@ g@@ less without you .
I couldn &apos;t cat@@ ch the train .
we have nothing else to eat .
I don &apos;t think I look much like me in that p@@ ho@@ to .
I think it &apos;s very li@@ k@@ ely that they &apos;ll arri@@ ve next week .
I don &apos;t dri@@ ve often .
Tom likes fol@@ k mu@@ si@@ c .
I &apos;m a big girl . I can h@@ and@@ le it .

I thought you car@@ ed about Tom .
this is the house where I li@@ ved when I was a child .
bro@@ thers should not qu@@ ar@@ re@@ l .
Tom says he knows something about Mary that we don &apos;t know yet .
I can &apos;t believe Tom did this to me .
you can &apos;t say that .
it &apos;s an in@@ side jo@@ ke .
the end ju@@ st@@ i@@ fi@@ es the me@@ ans .
I thought I heard something ou@@ t@@ side .

who gave you this car ?
I have ab@@ so@@ lu@@ t@@ ely no ar@@ ti@@ st@@ ic s@@ k@@ il@@ ls .
we need f@@ re@@ sh a@@ ir .
Tom or@@ der@@ ed ap@@ ple pi@@ e , and so did I .
there &apos;s h@@ ar@@ d@@ ly anything left to eat .
K@@ ate is looked up to by everybody .

there was bl@@ ood on Tom &apos;s face .
I can &apos;t stand all this no@@ i@@ se .
you &apos;re here , aren &apos;t you ?
what are you doing with your life ?
what &apos;s im@@ port@@ ant is that you &apos;re tr@@ ying .
I asked him if he knew her well .
do you remember what I ta@@ ught you ?
Tom and Mary are de@@ e@@ pl@@ y in love with each other .
it &apos;s about time .
why don &apos;t we go to the boo@@ k@@ st@@ ore on f@@ oo@@ t ?
she was fir@@ ed on the gr@@ oun@@ ds that she was often ab@@ s@@ ent .
who &apos;s jo@@ king ?
you should &apos;ve seen the look on Tom &apos;s face when I told him .

I &apos;ve never li@@ ked them .

I can &apos;t believe that Tom just left without sa@@ ying anything .
this is my fav@@ or@@ ite tr@@ ack on the enti@@ re dis@@ c .

before win@@ ter I &apos;ll have the windo@@ ws pa@@ in@@ ted , as the pa@@ int on them is s@@ low@@ ly pe@@ el@@ ing off , e@@ sp@@ ec@@ i@@ ally ou@@ t@@ side .
the b@@ ab@@ y can stand but can &apos;t walk .
Tom told me that you like to eat sp@@ ic@@ y food .
Tom called to say that he &apos;d be late .
I thought it was a jo@@ ke .
can any of us speak S@@ p@@ an@@ ish ?
do you have a m@@ en@@ u in English ?
the en@@ g@@ ine is p@@ ur@@ r@@ ing .
what do you have in your ba@@ g ?
isn &apos;t it enough for you ?
she is always com@@ pla@@ in@@ ing of her hu@@ s@@ b@@ and &apos;s small s@@ al@@ ary .

Tom c@@ la@@ im@@ s he doesn &apos;t watch much T@@ V , but he watch@@ es more than three hours every day .
he tal@@ ked to the c@@ ha@@ ir@@ man .
Tom said that he wanted to be left alone .
I &apos;m sure that Mary can take c@@ are of h@@ er@@ self .
where does Tom live ?
some@@ one left you a me@@ s@@ sa@@ ge .
how many people ?
just a mo@@ ment .
she rec@@ ei@@ ved the el@@ ec@@ tri@@ c@@ ity b@@ ill today .
the ex@@ por@@ t bu@@ sin@@ ess isn &apos;t doing well .

I know Tom is old .
who hel@@ ps her ?
W@@ ra@@ p the d@@ ough in cl@@ ear f@@ il@@ m and ch@@ ill for 1@@ 5 to 3@@ 0 minu@@ tes .
you won &apos;t find anyone who &apos;ll do that for you .
a c@@ at is l@@ ying on the so@@ f@@ a .
it made me a little sa@@ d .
Tom can &apos;t get along with Mary .
ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ly , don &apos;t be a str@@ ang@@ er .
Tom has been ex@@ tre@@ m@@ ely c@@ oo@@ per@@ ati@@ ve .
he has a sp@@ i@@ der fe@@ ti@@ sh .
I su@@ g@@ ge@@ st you stay out of my way .
my tra@@ v@@ el fe@@ es to Japan are pa@@ id for by the un@@ i@@ ver@@ s@@ ity .
are you sure that you want to do this ?
Mary lost her fav@@ or@@ ite p@@ en .
this st@@ ea@@ k is too t@@ ough .
D@@ r@@ . H@@ ide@@ o N@@ o@@ gu@@ ch@@ i died in A@@ fri@@ c@@ a in 1@@ 9@@ 2@@ 8 .
I will ra@@ i@@ se my children so that they will be pro@@ t@@ ec@@ ted from su@@ per@@ st@@ it@@ ion .
every day I go to the ca@@ f@@ é and have coffee .
I inv@@ ited him over to my place .
bu@@ g off !
she looked at me like I was c@@ raz@@ y .
you are the last person wh@@ om I exp@@ ec@@ ted to me@@ et here .
I have a me@@ s@@ sa@@ ge for Tom .
I st@@ ro@@ l@@ led along the stre@@ e@@ ts to k@@ ill time .
is it true that you ar@@ gu@@ ed with T@@ an@@ in@@ n@@ a ?
B@@ e@@ lie@@ f is the death of in@@ tel@@ li@@ g@@ ence .
life is for li@@ ving .
I thought Tom was Mary &apos;s father .
even the most beautiful r@@ ose will some@@ day w@@ il@@ t .
he is not coming , ei@@ ther .
Tom fin@@ ally got his wish .
are you coming to the st@@ ore with me ?
I am coun@@ ting in German .
you &apos;ve got your whole life a@@ hea@@ d of you .
Tom asked me who was resp@@ on@@ sible for the ac@@ cident .
I inter@@ pre@@ ted what he said in French into Japanese .
Tom is fa@@ ir@@ ly pre@@ ten@@ ti@@ ous .
he com@@ es to see me ne@@ ar@@ ly every day .
Tom is fu@@ ll of life .
do you have a vi@@ ol@@ in ?
Tom didn &apos;t want to talk with Mary .
it ra@@ is@@ es a red f@@ la@@ g for bu@@ sin@@ es@@ sm@@ en .
si@@ x times three e@@ qu@@ als ei@@ gh@@ te@@ en .
N@@ et @-@ pro@@ f@@ it com@@ es to 1@@ 0 mil@@ li@@ on do@@ l@@ lar@@ s every year .

I didn &apos;t exp@@ ect th@@ an@@ ks any@@ way .
she mi@@ st@@ ook me for my brother .
Japan im@@ por@@ ts v@@ ar@@ i@@ ous ra@@ w mat@@ er@@ i@@ als from ab@@ road .
I don &apos;t know ei@@ ther tw@@ in .
you won &apos;t have that problem .
they &apos;re self @-@ su@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ ent .
my gir@@ l@@ friend still doesn &apos;t know my parents .
his kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge of ge@@ o@@ gr@@ ap@@ h@@ y is in@@ su@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ ent .
that has nothing to do with you .
I wanted to talk to you about what happened .
Tom po@@ ked the fir@@ e with a st@@ ic@@ k .
there was once u@@ p@@ on a time a king who had tw@@ el@@ ve da@@ ugh@@ t@@ ers .
she s@@ wal@@ low@@ ed her pri@@ de .
you have made him what he is .
this is a story wr@@ it@@ ten in easy English .
you ought to find n@@ ice sho@@ es here .
it &apos;s not that bad .
it &apos;s c@@ lear@@ ing up .
do both Tom and Mary s@@ n@@ ore ?
qu@@ al@@ ity , not qu@@ an@@ t@@ ity .
don &apos;t h@@ es@@ it@@ ate to ask .
Mary told Tom that she thought John was im@@ po@@ li@@ te .
Tom la@@ ugh@@ ed at the mis@@ under@@ stan@@ ding .
Tom sp@@ ent three years in Australia .
I can &apos;t give you these .
we were all tired .
it looks like Tom only w@@ ears exp@@ en@@ si@@ ve clo@@ th@@ es .
that &apos;s prob@@ ab@@ ly the best idea to beg@@ in with .
nobody ans@@ w@@ ered my question .
how many p@@ and@@ as are there in this z@@ o@@ o ?
were you in Amer@@ ic@@ a last mon@@ th ?
I used to be a d@@ ru@@ g ad@@ dic@@ t .
if you don &apos;t want to do it , you don &apos;t have to .
do you have any ice t@@ on@@ gs ?
Tom s@@ ent Mary a picture of his new k@@ it@@ ten .
what &apos;ll Tom w@@ in ?
Tom l@@ ac@@ ks i@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ ation .
I &apos;m only here by mista@@ ke .
I &apos;ll sp@@ end Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as with my family .
your off@@ er is a life @-@ sa@@ ver .
Tom looks a little an@@ no@@ yed .
is that dog m@@ al@@ e or f@@ em@@ al@@ e ?
Mary &apos;s not pret@@ ty , but she isn &apos;t u@@ g@@ ly , ei@@ ther .
why is everything so comp@@ li@@ c@@ ated ?
my father is always busy .
S@@ am , don &apos;t !
&quot; Tom knows . &quot; &quot; he does ? did you tell him ? &quot;
I &apos;ll dea@@ l with this problem as soon as I can .
why doesn &apos;t Tom have to p@@ ay anything ?
I &apos;ve read that book .
she pos@@ t@@ p@@ on@@ ed her tri@@ p to M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o .
this book b@@ el@@ on@@ gs to P@@ a@@ ol@@ o .
she has long hair .
you should eat v@@ e@@ get@@ ab@@ les .
she wor@@ ked from morning t@@ ill night .
my un@@ cle , who lives in P@@ ar@@ is , came to see us .
do you read something be@@ si@@ d@@ es the B@@ i@@ ble ?
you &apos;re not plan@@ ning to stay up all night , are you ?
you are such a c@@ raz@@ y dri@@ ver ; you dri@@ ve me c@@ raz@@ y .
the Japanese like to tra@@ v@@ el in gr@@ ou@@ ps .
I de@@ sp@@ i@@ se my parents .
the p@@ rin@@ ce says that the world will be sa@@ ved by beau@@ ty ! and I ma@@ in@@ tain that the reason he has such pla@@ y@@ ful ide@@ as is that he is in love .
I don &apos;t understand how the hu@@ man b@@ rain wor@@ ks .
Tom made Mary very happy .
let &apos;s go home , Tom .
how can I be@@ come a tru@@ sted u@@ s@@ er ?
the st@@ ea@@ k is well done .
many comm@@ en@@ t@@ at@@ or@@ s re@@ g@@ ard O@@ ba@@ m@@ a as a cen@@ tri@@ st .
she tal@@ ked to the c@@ ha@@ ir@@ person .
who bu@@ il@@ t it ?
do you happ@@ en to know how to get do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn from here ?
Tom put everything back on the sh@@ el@@ f .
don &apos;t you think I know my own wife ?
I knew he was waiting for Mary .
I am di@@ v@@ or@@ ced .
I wish you &apos;d stop doing that .
don &apos;t try to fri@@ gh@@ ten me .
she &apos;s not a good c@@ ook .
if I had enough money , I could buy this book .
Tom and Mary went hun@@ ting for E@@ a@@ ster e@@ g@@ gs .
I am happy to hear your vo@@ ice .
the Japanese are g@@ en@@ er@@ ally con@@ si@@ der@@ ed to be very in@@ du@@ st@@ ri@@ ous .
the mi@@ st pre@@ ven@@ ted him from se@@ e@@ ing very far .
I &apos;ve done that a few times .
the last time that I sm@@ el@@ led something si@@ mil@@ a@@ r to this te@@ a was in the gir@@ a@@ ff@@ e house at the z@@ o@@ o .
I &apos;ve never been so happy to see p@@ ot@@ at@@ o@@ es in my life .
is it true that you &apos;ve never pla@@ yed po@@ k@@ er before ?
it &apos;s hard to please him .
I &apos;ve tried everything .
a s@@ qu@@ are has f@@ our ang@@ les .
I don &apos;t have time to listen to your life story .
she fell in love with her teacher .
his da@@ ugh@@ ter is a n@@ ur@@ se .
it &apos;s very cold this win@@ ter .
why don &apos;t you say anything ?
Tom left the room .
she k@@ illed time reading a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine while she wa@@ ited .
have you ever tra@@ vel@@ led by plan@@ e ?
Tom won@@ der@@ ed what Mary was so u@@ p@@ s@@ et about .
I didn &apos;t want to look f@@ oo@@ lish .
Tom p@@ as@@ sed the bu@@ tter to Mary .
Tom bought a r@@ ose and gave it to Mary .
I can &apos;t tell you the reason why I did that .
you &apos;re really gi@@ f@@ ted .
my mother &apos;s re@@ li@@ g@@ ion hel@@ ped her to come to ter@@ ms with my father &apos;s death .
stop h@@ it@@ ting Tom .
th@@ ank you , C@@ ap@@ tain O@@ b@@ vi@@ ous .
I used to keep a di@@ ary when I was at hi@@ gh school .
how many differ@@ ent pi@@ ec@@ es are there in Japanese ch@@ ess ?
I know that doesn &apos;t look good .
should I go to the party ?
Tom br@@ ought his dog to school .
is there any problem with f@@ ee@@ ding my dog ice c@@ rea@@ m ?
a fore@@ ig@@ n language can &apos;t be ma@@ st@@ ered in a year or so .
let me give this to you before I for@@ get .
Tom came at an in@@ op@@ port@@ un@@ e time .
Tom didn &apos;t have a ch@@ ance .
the st@@ at@@ em@@ ent s@@ oun@@ ds im@@ prob@@ able .
he lost the watch which he had bought the day before .
my le@@ gs are as hea@@ v@@ y as lea@@ d .
Tom was s@@ c@@ rea@@ m@@ ing .
why would Tom li@@ e about something like that ?
Tom and Mary told John they wanted Alice to t@@ each them how to do that .
I &apos;m waiting for a resp@@ on@@ se .
I ho@@ pe I never me@@ et him again .
what do I o@@ we him ?
this pro@@ gra@@ m has an in@@ tu@@ it@@ i@@ ve u@@ s@@ er inter@@ face .
it de@@ p@@ ends on the s@@ it@@ u@@ ation .
wa@@ it@@ er , the ch@@ ec@@ k , please .
Tom and Mary told John that they thought Alice was a@@ wa@@ ke .
where would you go if you could time tra@@ v@@ el ?
how long do you in@@ t@@ end to sp@@ end at the li@@ br@@ ary ?
Tom often go@@ es there .
this can@@ di@@ d@@ ate is si@@ g@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ an@@ tly better com@@ par@@ ed to his pre@@ de@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ or .
I &apos;ll know what to do .
the bir@@ d was looking for wor@@ ms .
she pre@@ ten@@ ded to be a stu@@ dent .
my fav@@ our@@ ite col@@ our is red .
money can &apos;t buy life .
you &apos;re just j@@ eal@@ ous .
Tom and Mary told John that they didn &apos;t think Alice was sle@@ ep@@ y .
he has good reason to get very ang@@ ry .
Tom will try .
Tom and Mary were both bor@@ n in Boston .
she ac@@ ce@@ ded to our de@@ man@@ ds .
M@@ an@@ ag@@ em@@ ent tried to app@@ ea@@ se l@@ ab@@ or by off@@ er@@ ing them a b@@ on@@ us .
I mis@@ sed the po@@ int of the jo@@ ke .
Tom told me to be kind to o@@ thers .
by the way , how old are you ?
they wal@@ ked along the stre@@ et side by side .
what was I talking about , again ?
Tom is n@@ on@@ pl@@ u@@ s@@ sed .
you may say that it &apos;s sh@@ it .
everything app@@ ears to be going well .
I &apos;m looking for some@@ one who speaks German .
I &apos;d never do something like that .
I &apos;m not as@@ ha@@ med that I am p@@ oor .
Tom has to take me@@ dic@@ ine every three hours .
a c@@ oo@@ ki@@ e is un@@ der the table .
why &apos;d you do that ?
M@@ ar@@ i@@ e had a c@@ at .
give Tom his k@@ e@@ ys .
the v@@ il@@ l@@ age was s@@ il@@ ent .
that &apos;s why I told you that you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t go alone .
I didn &apos;t really like the st@@ e@@ w that Tom made .
not so qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly , children , I &apos;m not so young any@@ more !
he is not a po@@ li@@ ti@@ ci@@ an but a la@@ w@@ y@@ er .
I &apos;ll help you as soon as I &apos;ve done that .
we look for@@ w@@ ard to your en@@ tri@@ es .
he &apos;s un@@ con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous .
leave me alone .
I don &apos;t understand this word . could you par@@ ap@@ h@@ ra@@ se it ?
h@@ i , S@@ u@@ s@@ an . how are you ?
let &apos;s star@@ t with you .
I &apos;m too old for this .
Tom only sle@@ ep@@ s about fi@@ ve hours a night .
are you sure Tom can do it by himself ?
road tra@@ ff@@ ic in@@ ju@@ ri@@ es are a ma@@ j@@ or pu@@ b@@ li@@ c heal@@ th problem and a lea@@ ding cause of death .
I know you think this is a stu@@ p@@ id thing to do , but I plan to do it any@@ way .
no p@@ as@@ sen@@ g@@ ers were in@@ j@@ ur@@ ed .
I &apos;m no lon@@ ger stud@@ ying French .

Tom is a big boy .

Tom and Mary were busy .

don &apos;t keep bad comp@@ any .
there &apos;s no re@@ st for the w@@ ic@@ ked .
please don &apos;t t@@ ou@@ ch the ice with b@@ are han@@ ds .
you should tell him the tru@@ th .
we think that the n@@ ar@@ row road was resp@@ on@@ sible for the ac@@ cident .
you &apos;re going to have to p@@ ay in ad@@ v@@ ance .
we need more tal@@ en@@ ted people .
her parents are ol@@ der than our@@ s .
I &apos;m wor@@ ried for you .
Tom lives n@@ ear us .
ha@@ ving been left alone , the b@@ ab@@ y started to c@@ ry .
Tom should be here after l@@ un@@ ch .
almost three th@@ ous@@ and people died .
sor@@ ry , I didn &apos;t me@@ an to inter@@ ru@@ p@@ t you .
the book is new .
Tom has really ta@@ ught me many things .
Tom and Mary are the only sur@@ vi@@ v@@ or@@ s .
this is how I did it .
the D@@ i@@ et broke up in con@@ fu@@ sion .
Tom would tre@@ at you with resp@@ ect .
nobody can fore@@ see what &apos;ll happ@@ en .
Tom ta@@ kes after his father .
I already spo@@ ke to Tom .
I can &apos;t see the road si@@ g@@ n@@ s in this fo@@ g .
Tom ma@@ kes a lot more money than I do .

Tom is interest@@ ed in French li@@ ter@@ at@@ ure .
get ready for school .
Tom put his han@@ ds on Mary &apos;s sh@@ oul@@ d@@ ers .
all the p@@ as@@ sen@@ g@@ ers were k@@ illed in the cr@@ as@@ h .
what good are those ?
do you pre@@ f@@ er cu@@ te gu@@ ys or gu@@ ys who have cl@@ ass ?
I told W@@ il@@ li@@ am , but he didn &apos;t believe me .
Tom speaks French , doesn &apos;t he ?
&quot; ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tion , your h@@ on@@ or . &quot; &quot; O@@ ver@@ ru@@ led . &quot;
almost everyone I know can speak French .
can I see you in my off@@ ice for a minu@@ te ?
you &apos;re not C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an .
they gre@@ w ang@@ ry .
I &apos;m not sure who they were .
the first it@@ em on Tom &apos;s li@@ st of things to take with him on his tri@@ p is his mo@@ b@@ ile phone re@@ ch@@ ar@@ ger .
have you deci@@ ded wh@@ e@@ ther you are going into to@@ wn by bi@@ ke or by bu@@ s ?
were both Tom and Mary bor@@ n in Australia ?
what col@@ or car did you buy ?
I think that you &apos;re wrong .

O@@ h , my G@@ o@@ d !

Tom wan@@ der@@ ed off .
I &apos;ll pro@@ t@@ ect Tom .
this re@@ gu@@ l@@ ation will take e@@ ff@@ ect next year .
we b@@ ar@@ red the door and lo@@ c@@ ked it .
the little boy gre@@ w very fast .
I was bor@@ ed .
Tom said he didn &apos;t know why Mary had to do that .
ri@@ ch as he is , he is not happy .
she &apos;s such a s@@ wee@@ the@@ ar@@ t .
your ex@@ plan@@ ation is too ab@@ str@@ ac@@ t for me .
V@@ ir@@ tu@@ es and gir@@ ls are most beautiful before kno@@ w@@ ing that they are beautiful .
he s@@ la@@ m@@ med the door right in my face .
we will have a mat@@ h qu@@ i@@ z tomorrow .
I have a b@@ ic@@ y@@ cle .
I don &apos;t feel com@@ for@@ table here .
Tom doesn &apos;t tru@@ st the go@@ ver@@ n@@ ment .
this is what he said .
the reason I su@@ cc@@ ee@@ ded was because I was lu@@ ck@@ y .
she has a k@@ e@@ en bu@@ sin@@ ess sen@@ se .
she is list@@ en@@ ing to him .
ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly I ag@@ ree that you should ad@@ v@@ ance in life through your own e@@ ff@@ or@@ ts .
Tom is not w@@ el@@ come in this house .
I have a me@@ s@@ sa@@ ge for you from her .
before going to F@@ r@@ ance , M@@ r@@ . S@@ u@@ z@@ u@@ k@@ i stu@@ died French .

a cold rain fell over the c@@ ity .
when should I pic@@ k you up tomorrow ?
S@@ o@@ ci@@ al@@ is@@ m never took r@@ oo@@ t in Amer@@ ic@@ a because the p@@ oor see the@@ m@@ sel@@ ves not as an ex@@ pl@@ o@@ ited pro@@ le@@ t@@ ar@@ i@@ at , but as t@@ em@@ por@@ ar@@ il@@ y e@@ mb@@ ar@@ r@@ as@@ sed mil@@ li@@ on@@ a@@ i@@ res .

there are a c@@ ou@@ ple of par@@ ks not too far from my house .
what else is there to say ?
he prob@@ ab@@ ly won &apos;t come .

Mary ha@@ s@@ n &apos;t pa@@ in@@ ted her room yet .

I thought that wor@@ king in a Japanese comp@@ any would im@@ pro@@ ve my Japanese , but it has only ser@@ ved to s@@ how me how far I still have to go .
nobody can do that better than Tom .
she wanted to get away from every@@ day life .
I never in@@ ten@@ ded to hur@@ t you .
there &apos;s one thing I don &apos;t understand .
she had never seen N@@ e@@ w Y@@ or@@ k before , so I off@@ ered to s@@ how her around .

Tom took a picture .

Tom di@@ v@@ or@@ ced Mary .
she was busy doing her ho@@ me@@ work .
nobody wants to play with Tom .
would you be kind enough to write ?
I re@@ p@@ li@@ ed that I didn &apos;t have parents any more .

I want to mar@@ ry Tom .

Tom almost got ca@@ ught .
Tom had for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten his u@@ mb@@ re@@ l@@ l@@ a so I l@@ ent him one of m@@ ine .
Tom thought about this .
so@@ ci@@ al cu@@ sto@@ ms v@@ ary from country to country .
I &apos;m not sure about that . it de@@ p@@ ends .
Tom doesn &apos;t want to live in Boston for more than a year .
I sp@@ ent the whole day in the par@@ k .
to make a long story sh@@ or@@ t , we married .
she fell as@@ le@@ ep on my sh@@ oul@@ der .

Tom is lu@@ ck@@ y he has so many friends .
I &apos;m tur@@ ning the light off .
su@@ ga@@ r will dis@@ sol@@ ve in a gl@@ ass of water qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly .
Tom always speaks in such a low vo@@ ice that I can b@@ ar@@ ely understand what he says .
that &apos;s not what I asked you .
you &apos;ll go to school tomorrow .
my father came home at n@@ ine .
Tom be@@ came a whi@@ st@@ le@@ b@@ lo@@ wer .

Tom di@@ v@@ or@@ ced Mary after the children gra@@ du@@ ated from col@@ le@@ ge .
this is the most ab@@ sur@@ d thing I have ever heard .

Tom said he &apos;ll do that .
it &apos;s too bad that Tom is si@@ ck .

I like the Japanese language very much .
Tom is di@@ st@@ ur@@ b@@ ing Mary .

have you tried it before ?
what does this have to do with my family ?
he is about for@@ ty .
ei@@ gh@@ ty per@@ cent of su@@ cc@@ ess is sho@@ w@@ ing up .
you can &apos;t leave me here alone .
what would I do without you ?
Tom was lon@@ ely .
Tom didn &apos;t understand the question .
there were many who couldn &apos;t re@@ co@@ g@@ ni@@ ze him in that dis@@ gu@@ i@@ se .
Tom &apos;s c@@ el@@ l@@ phone is rin@@ g@@ ing .
I don &apos;t know when Tom will leave Japan .
I don &apos;t think he can h@@ and@@ le the tru@@ th .
&quot; why , A@@ n@@ ne , how you &apos;ve g@@ ro@@ wn ! &quot; she said , almost un@@ belie@@ v@@ in@@ g@@ ly .
I got back in my car .
a s@@ mar@@ t f@@ al@@ c@@ on hi@@ d@@ es its tal@@ ons .
we had n@@ ati@@ ve gu@@ i@@ d@@ es on our tri@@ p to the m@@ oun@@ tain .
if you plan well , you can sp@@ end less time doing un@@ ne@@ c@@ es@@ s@@ ary things and get the work done fa@@ ster .
she sle@@ p@@ t for a few hours .
Mary o@@ w@@ n@@ s a y@@ el@@ low sp@@ or@@ ts car .

I &apos;m from C@@ ro@@ ati@@ a .

there is a p@@ ost off@@ ice at the end of the stre@@ et .
he vis@@ ited the co@@ a@@ st of S@@ ou@@ th Amer@@ ic@@ a in 1@@ 4@@ 9@@ 9 .
John is a good friend of m@@ ine .
tell Tom you can &apos;t do it .
you cannot see your own face without a m@@ ir@@ r@@ or .
Y@@ es , sa@@ u@@ sa@@ ge and sa@@ u@@ er@@ k@@ ra@@ u@@ t please .
Tom thought Mary &apos;s plan wasn &apos;t any good .
wh@@ en@@ ever he ex@@ pla@@ ins something , he can &apos;t stop . he ra@@ mb@@ les on .
the st@@ ore op@@ en@@ s for bu@@ sin@@ ess tomorrow .
if I were you , I would do the same .
the girl was always fol@@ low@@ ing her mother .
I was fin@@ ed si@@ x th@@ ous@@ and y@@ en for a par@@ king vi@@ ol@@ ation .
I &apos;ve been waiting for you all day .
I met an old man who says that he &apos;s never ea@@ ten at a re@@ sta@@ ur@@ ant in his whole life .
I would swi@@ m through the o@@ ce@@ an just to see your s@@ mil@@ e again .
Tom said I was already un@@ con@@ s@@ ci@@ ous by the time the par@@ a@@ me@@ dic@@ s arrived .
this w@@ ri@@ st@@ watch is very v@@ al@@ u@@ able .
that is the thing that con@@ cer@@ n@@ s you .
this T@@ V was made ten years ag@@ o and there are no par@@ ts a@@ v@@ a@@ il@@ able , so it is im@@ possible to re@@ pa@@ ir it .
Tom lo@@ ves being around people .
the cri@@ min@@ al was app@@ re@@ h@@ en@@ ded by an off @-@ du@@ ty po@@ li@@ ce@@ man .
I don &apos;t want to write with this p@@ en .
I want to tell you that I won &apos;t be here tomorrow .
know th@@ y@@ self !
I con@@ f@@ es@@ sed my s@@ in .
V@@ al@@ en@@ t@@ in@@ a T@@ er@@ es@@ h@@ k@@ o@@ v@@ a was the first woman in sp@@ a@@ ce .
I &apos;d think you &apos;d understand .
what a di@@ g@@ ni@@ fi@@ ed man !
please p@@ ass it to the other friends .
a stor@@ m is b@@ re@@ w@@ ing .
Tom told Mary that he loved Alice .
my m@@ om bought me this to@@ y when I was e@@ ight years old .
she &apos;s dea@@ f and mu@@ te , and is getting bl@@ ind , too .
Mary isn &apos;t pret@@ ty , but Alice is .
he has a bad re@@ pu@@ t@@ ation with his stud@@ ents .
she went on wor@@ king t@@ ill he called her .
it &apos;s just be@@ tw@@ e@@ en you and me , but K@@ a@@ z@@ u@@ o &apos;s wife is pre@@ g@@ n@@ ant .
why don &apos;t you wa@@ it unti@@ l Tom ge@@ ts here ?
we should drink 6@@ 4 oun@@ ces of f@@ lu@@ i@@ ds a day .
don &apos;t make me do this .
b@@ an@@ an@@ as are en@@ er@@ gi@@ z@@ ing .
I &apos;ve been si@@ ck in bed since last M@@ on@@ day .
Tom lo@@ ves Mary with all his hear@@ t .
Tom &apos;s dog at@@ t@@ ac@@ ked Mary .
it must be the pos@@ t@@ man .
I met your gir@@ l@@ friend .
I &apos;m so tired that I &apos;m going to bed as soon as I get home .
are you looking for anything in par@@ ti@@ cu@@ la@@ r ?
he has three bro@@ thers .
Tom heard Mary y@@ el@@ ling .
which do you pre@@ f@@ er , te@@ a or coffee ?
Tom ex@@ pres@@ sed himself c@@ lear@@ ly .
I asked for a se@@ at in the no @-@ s@@ mo@@ king se@@ c@@ tion .
don &apos;t ever talk to me like that again .
after they ar@@ gu@@ ed , they didn &apos;t speak to each other for a week .
that was only a year ag@@ o .
I look for@@ w@@ ard to reading your re@@ por@@ t .
it &apos;s v@@ ir@@ tu@@ ally im@@ possible for Tom to p@@ ass the ex@@ am .
who else u@@ ses it ?
Tom is now mi@@ dd@@ le age and has ser@@ i@@ ous heal@@ th proble@@ ms .
who re@@ mo@@ ved it ?
this is a f@@ as@@ c@@ in@@ at@@ ing book .
that &apos;s great ! I &apos;ll look at it lat@@ er .
Tom still cal@@ ls French fri@@ es F@@ re@@ e@@ d@@ om fri@@ es .
Mary is my gir@@ l@@ friend .
the p@@ in@@ k p@@ il@@ low is c@@ le@@ an .
Mary will never understand why we want her to do this .
to each his own .
there are fi@@ f@@ ty star@@ s on the Amer@@ i@@ can f@@ la@@ g .
I didn &apos;t know you were coming to vis@@ it .
I could make you happy .
you &apos;re b@@ ra@@ ver than I am .
I broke that one .
Mary told Tom that she thought John was im@@ po@@ li@@ te .
I don &apos;t want to go ou@@ t@@ side on a day like this .
could you ex@@ pl@@ ain it to me ?
Tom often ac@@ ts like a b@@ ab@@ y when he can &apos;t get his way .
how many pen@@ s do you have ?
I won@@ der why Tom is cr@@ ying .
she ta@@ kes par@@ t in many school ac@@ ti@@ v@@ it@@ ies .
all an@@ im@@ als are e@@ qu@@ al .
he ap@@ pro@@ a@@ ch@@ ed with tre@@ mb@@ ling and ad@@ m@@ ir@@ ation , and fell down u@@ p@@ on his k@@ ne@@ es before her .
men who were b@@ er@@ e@@ ft of reason con@@ du@@ c@@ ted the wa@@ r .
why are you pre@@ ten@@ ding you don &apos;t remember ?
I saw you yesterday .
Tom is just going to need some time .
L@@ a@@ w@@ y@@ ers are all li@@ ar@@ s .
this is Tom &apos;s car , I think .
I won@@ der who the people I saw her with were .
even I can understand this sen@@ t@@ ence . it &apos;s very easy to understand .
I exp@@ ect that Tom will w@@ in .
Tom and his bu@@ d@@ di@@ es s@@ li@@ t the th@@ ro@@ at@@ s of el@@ even men and wo@@ men .

F@@ re@@ e@@ d@@ om is a new re@@ li@@ g@@ ion , the re@@ li@@ g@@ ion of our time .

he dis@@ app@@ ear@@ ed again .
Tom is the one who told me how to do it .
he u@@ tt@@ ers an exc@@ la@@ m@@ ation of an@@ no@@ y@@ ance .
Tom just took a ch@@ ance and called Mary to ask her out .
he &apos;s a gar@@ d@@ en@@ er .
I &apos;m Tom &apos;s teacher .
it being cl@@ ou@@ dy , I took my u@@ mb@@ re@@ l@@ l@@ a with me .
have you ever hu@@ g@@ g@@ ed your children ?
Tom took the bot@@ t@@ le from Mary and p@@ ou@@ red himself a drink .
Tom is very po@@ li@@ te .

I know who to call when I need help .
let &apos;s sup@@ p@@ ose it &apos;s true .

all his life Tom was an ou@@ t@@ si@@ der .
Tom c@@ ru@@ m@@ pl@@ ed up the p@@ aper and th@@ re@@ w it in the tr@@ as@@ h@@ can .
there &apos;s a lot of tra@@ ff@@ ic on that stre@@ et .
what do you think of wa@@ r ?
I saw something wh@@ ite in the par@@ k .
li@@ ving in the to@@ wn is quite differ@@ ent from li@@ ving in the country .
he is ta@@ king a walk .
down it came and away went the day .
&quot; you don &apos;t know how to s@@ mo@@ ke ? &quot; &quot; of c@@ our@@ se I know how to s@@ mo@@ ke ! &quot;

we &apos;ve been here since 2@@ 0@@ 1@@ 3 .
I wa@@ ited .
he w@@ ei@@ gh@@ ed the st@@ one in his h@@ and .
Tom could have sur@@ vi@@ ved if the am@@ bu@@ l@@ ance had arrived a little so@@ on@@ er .
Tom is one of our best de@@ t@@ ec@@ ti@@ ves .
Mary l@@ ay a@@ wa@@ ke h@@ al@@ f the night , list@@ en@@ ing to Tom s@@ n@@ or@@ ing .
read the kind of boo@@ ks that t@@ each you something .
he &apos;s very f@@ on@@ d of wal@@ king .
he likes reading boo@@ ks .
I will only say this once , so listen car@@ e@@ fu@@ l@@ ly .
did they say what happened ?
Tom can &apos;t remember how to use the sh@@ re@@ d@@ der .
which is right : I@@ ra@@ q or I@@ r@@ an ?
where has she lear@@ ned I@@ tal@@ i@@ an ?
did you sol@@ ve the problem ?
my a@@ un@@ t d@@ ro@@ p@@ ped in on me yesterday .
the U@@ .@@ S@@ . gu@@ n ho@@ m@@ ic@@ i@@ de r@@ ate is 1@@ 5 times hi@@ gh@@ er than other po@@ pu@@ l@@ ous , hi@@ gh in@@ come coun@@ tri@@ es .
no an@@ im@@ als are to be found on the is@@ land .
Tom couldn &apos;t go to col@@ le@@ ge .
our n@@ ation is very f@@ on@@ d of b@@ as@@ e@@ b@@ all .
I &apos;m not ans@@ w@@ er@@ ing that question .
there was a h@@ al@@ f @-@ ea@@ ten pi@@ z@@ z@@ a on the f@@ loo@@ r .
I am wr@@ iting on be@@ h@@ al@@ f of my hu@@ s@@ b@@ and , who is in the h@@ os@@ p@@ it@@ al .
my watch is fi@@ ve minu@@ tes fast .
we have to do it together .
I &apos;m ol@@ der than you , so of c@@ our@@ se I know better .
Tom knows what he wants to say .
I like pla@@ ying b@@ as@@ e@@ b@@ all .
I like the way you talk .
I know I &apos;ve been ac@@ ting str@@ ang@@ ely .
the p@@ en S@@ ar@@ a@@ h gave me is not b@@ lu@@ e .
a bl@@ ind man as@@ ks only for one ey@@ e , but would re@@ jo@@ ice if he got two .
I don &apos;t believe one word of it .
which way is the b@@ each ?
I like that pi@@ e@@ ce of f@@ ur@@ n@@ it@@ ure very much .
we will be stud@@ ying at the U@@ ni@@ ver@@ s@@ ity of S@@ an F@@ r@@ an@@ c@@ is@@ c@@ o in S@@ ep@@ te@@ mber .
why are you cr@@ ying ?
I &apos;ve pa@@ in@@ ted the ce@@ il@@ ing .
that &apos;s ch@@ ea@@ ting .
three c@@ li@@ mb@@ ers were k@@ illed in a ro@@ ck f@@ all .
this is the only thing that was left .
Tom lo@@ ves pi@@ z@@ z@@ a and f@@ rench fri@@ es .
I was tru@@ ly per@@ pl@@ ex@@ ed .
she st@@ op@@ ped reading the ne@@ w@@ sp@@ aper .
when did you vis@@ it K@@ yo@@ to last ?
Tom pla@@ yed with his ki@@ ds .
we heard the e@@ ch@@ o of our vo@@ ic@@ es from the other side of the v@@ al@@ le@@ y .
I &apos;m the bad one .
she married John , not because she loved him , but because he was a ri@@ ch man .
then the K@@ ing said to his wife , &quot; I@@ f the thir@@ te@@ en@@ th child which th@@ o@@ u ar@@ t about to br@@ ing into the world , is a girl , the tw@@ el@@ ve bo@@ ys sh@@ all di@@ e , in or@@ der that her pos@@ se@@ s@@ si@@ ons may be great , and that the k@@ in@@ g@@ d@@ om may f@@ all to her alone . &quot;
there is some e@@ vi@@ d@@ ence that ta@@ king se@@ ver@@ al f@@ ish o@@ il c@@ ap@@ su@@ les p@@ er day could have b@@ en@@ e@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al e@@ ff@@ ec@@ ts on one &apos;s hear@@ t and bl@@ ood pres@@ sure .
he has a lot of friends here .
it was a very tr@@ ad@@ it@@ i@@ on@@ al cer@@ e@@ mon@@ y .
he likes to c@@ ook for his family .
this ru@@ le rea@@ ds se@@ ver@@ al ways .
Tom is plan@@ ning on en@@ ter@@ ing the com@@ pe@@ t@@ it@@ ion , right ?
she didn &apos;t have much money .
the hea@@ v@@ y rain pre@@ ven@@ ted me from going out .
I never wanted you to go .
are you ma@@ d that you should do such a thing ?
they don &apos;t want you . they want Tom .
keep away from that .
we have not heard from him since last year .
I sho@@ wer once a day .
I tried to t@@ each my@@ self how to play the gu@@ it@@ a@@ r .
Tom met Mary by ch@@ ance on his way home from school .
Tom was sur@@ pri@@ sed by Mary &apos;s cho@@ ice of wor@@ ds .
I have a lot of friends in Ger@@ many .
the f@@ ile was st@@ ol@@ en .
I was just tr@@ ying to help .
Tom likes reading H@@ er@@ man@@ n H@@ es@@ se .
Y@@ es , of c@@ our@@ se !
the man stan@@ ding over there next to the boo@@ k@@ ca@@ se has a p@@ ho@@ to@@ gr@@ ap@@ hi@@ c me@@ mor@@ y .
the tr@@ ou@@ ble with quot@@ es on the I@@ n@@ ter@@ ne@@ t is that you never know wh@@ e@@ ther or not they are g@@ en@@ u@@ ine .
why isn &apos;t the s@@ mo@@ ke going up the ch@@ im@@ ne@@ y like it &apos;s sup@@ pos@@ ed to ?
h@@ ell has no fir@@ e of its own : each person b@@ rin@@ gs his own fir@@ e with him .
A@@ o@@ i d@@ an@@ ces well .
I came here alone .
the b@@ as@@ em@@ ents of the hou@@ ses are li@@ k@@ ely to have proble@@ ms .
why did you want us to come here ?
Tom can &apos;t a@@ ff@@ or@@ d to get married .
Tom doesn &apos;t like ki@@ ds .
I &apos;ll let Tom know you called .
Tom told me that he was a@@ mb@@ ide@@ x@@ tr@@ ous .
it will c@@ ost around fi@@ f@@ te@@ en do@@ l@@ lar@@ s .
please turn down the ra@@ di@@ o .
the train was so c@@ row@@ ded that I had to stand all the way .
do you pro@@ mi@@ se not to tell anyone else ?
I ho@@ pe you don &apos;t take this the wrong way .
the b@@ ar@@ ten@@ der k@@ ic@@ ked Tom out of the ba@@ r .
to tell the tru@@ th , I &apos;m tired of vi@@ ol@@ ent mo@@ vi@@ es .
a friend to everybody is a friend to nobody .
what u@@ tter n@@ on@@ sen@@ se .
do you know him at all ?
now you &apos;ve gi@@ ven yourself away .
you were right to wor@@ ry .
Tom was b@@ it@@ ten by a s@@ na@@ ke while he was on v@@ ac@@ ation .
our love will last fore@@ ver .
I &apos;ve already fin@@ ished my work .
would you like something to drink ?
do you want me to give you a h@@ and ?
he never really got over her death .
he &apos;s never at a l@@ os@@ s for wor@@ ds .
Tom is my h@@ al@@ f brother .
M@@ r S@@ m@@ ith is too po@@ li@@ te to say anything bad about o@@ thers .
how long did you work for Tom ?
we &apos;ll vis@@ it you tomorrow .
we &apos;ve en@@ d@@ ur@@ ed for long enough .
my inter@@ est is in the fu@@ ture because I am going to sp@@ end the re@@ st of my life there .
don &apos;t tell F@@ a@@ ther about this .
you look happy today .
he likes watch@@ ing T@@ V .
Tom was tr@@ app@@ ed in an el@@ e@@ v@@ at@@ or for 4@@ 1 hours .
she wants him .
we were in the li@@ ving room when we heard the g@@ un@@ sho@@ t .
let us go home .
I w@@ ro@@ te this letter in French .
Tom f@@ el@@ t sa@@ d .
Tom has a sto@@ m@@ ac@@ ha@@ c@@ he .
you know this is a mista@@ ke .
why don &apos;t you go out ?
let &apos;s stay together . it &apos;ll be sa@@ f@@ er that way .
he &apos;s an ar@@ ti@@ st .
don &apos;t you have more to say ?
this person is a teacher .
the ki@@ d@@ n@@ app@@ ers g@@ ag@@ g@@ ed Tom and Mary and lo@@ c@@ ked them up in the cl@@ os@@ et .
S@@ p@@ an@@ ish is spo@@ ken in C@@ en@@ tr@@ al and S@@ ou@@ th Amer@@ ic@@ a .
