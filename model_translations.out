Please c@@ a@@ me for a s@@ p@@ e@@ e@@ c@@ h of your h@@ a@@ p@@ p@@ y.

Let me help you.
We have a f@@ o@@ u@@ n@@ d.

Why don't you like Tom?
It's p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ y here.

Tom is very r@@ i@@ c@@ h, isn't you?

Mary didn't h@@ e@@ a@@ r Tom.

She is c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ y.

Tom told me he's h@@ u@@ n@@ g@@ r@@ y.
B@@ e@@ a@@ u@@ t@@ i@@ f@@ u@@ l t@@ h@@ e@@ n you want to s@@ t@@ u@@ d@@ y.
We thought you were.
It's Tom s@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ c@@ e to s@@ t@@ u@@ d@@ y.


It's a b@@ e@@ s@@ t t@@ h@@ i@@ r@@ t@@ y.

He's not e@@ a@@ s@@ y to me.
Tom doesn't s@@ e@@ e@@ m to be a@@ b@@ l@@ e.

Let's s@@ t@@ a@@ y s@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ ted.
Tom has l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ s for a h@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ work.

Tom has a f@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ o@@ w.

Tom and Mary told John that they thought A@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ e was t@@ h@@ in@@ g@@ s.
You're everything what I was in the w@@ o@@ r@@ l@@ d.
She was t@@ a@@ l@@ k@@ ing in the g@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ father.
E@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ e has a f@@ a@@ r of p@@ l@@ a@@ y.

It's only a p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ y p@@ a@@ p@@ e@@ r.
This b@@ u@@ s@@ y p@@ l@@ a@@ y is very s@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ c@@ e.

Is it something?
He's a s@@ t@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ t.
Tom is a s@@ t@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ t of the G@@ o@@ r@@ o.
Tom and Mary told John that they didn't have to do it.
Tom was the w@@ a@@ r@@ d day.

T@@ h@@ a@@ n@@ k you for your f@@ r@@ i@@ e@@ n@@ d of your f@@ r@@ i@@ e@@ n@@ d.


Do you speak well?

Now it good.

How do you want to s@@ t@@ a@@ y your s@@ t@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ on?
P@@ e@@ r@@ m@@ a@@ n@@ s Tom has to help Tom.

Tom was t@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ t@@ ed by Mary.
That's w@@ o@@ r@@ k@@ ing for the g@@ a@@ me.
What do it b@@ u@@ y if a m@@ o@@ v@@ e@@ n c@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ t?
You should be t@@ e@@ a@@ c@@ h@@ e@@ r.
We think we'll t@@ a@@ l@@ k to the t@@ h@@ ing.
Tom has a m@@ a@@ t@@ t@@ e@@ r.

I've been s@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ c@@ e I had a long s@@ t@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ t.

You're l@@ i@@ v@@ ing in the p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ y.
The p@@ e@@ r@@ s@@ on is very p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ y in the p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ y.
The r@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ e@@ r was f@@ a@@ r from the w@@ o@@ r@@ d.
Tom is s@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ ted with me.

Tom has a lot of t@@ h@@ in@@ g@@ s.

How many people are in your d@@ e@@ a@@ d?
Did you come my n@@ e@@ x@@ t c@@ h@@ e@@ s@@ s?
Mary is really s@@ m@@ o@@ k@@ ing today.
Tom didn't re@@ m@@ e@@ m@@ b@@ e@@ r.
Tom s@@ e@@ n@@ t the b@@ o@@ r@@ k@@ s.

I'm too p@@ o@@ l@@ i@@ t@@ e to go.
He has already s@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ ted to s@@ t@@ a@@ y a@@ n@@ y@@ more.
What did Tom and Mary s@@ t@@ a@@ y@@ ed about Mary?
Everything you need to be c@@ o@@ m@@ ing to c@@ all the c@@ h@@ e@@ s@@ s.
I'm so a s@@ e@@ e@@ p.


Tom's s@@ h@@ o@@ w@@ e@@ r is h@@ a@@ r@@ d.
Tom asked me to s@@ t@@ a@@ y something.
E@@ v@@ e@@ n c@@ h@@ e@@ s@@ s c@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ e@@ r@@ v@@ ed me.

Tom is a m@@ o@@ r@@ n@@ ing of m@@ o@@ r@@ n@@ ing m@@ o@@ r@@ n@@ ing.

Do you p@@ l@@ a@@ y a s@@ t@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ t?

What's your house?
Do you think me?
I don't speak J@@ a@@ p@@ a@@ n@@ e@@ s@@ e.
I saw him to a w@@ o@@ r@@ d.
The d@@ o@@ or is 3@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0.
There's no one of the w@@ o@@ r@@ d.
Is it s@@ a@@ me to l@@ e@@ a@@ r@@ n French?
Tell me how you're h@@ a@@ p@@ p@@ y.
Don't e@@ x@@ p@@ e@@ c@@ t me as I'm.
He's not d@@ r@@ in@@ k c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ y.
Where were you going to be a s@@ t@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ t?
Is and l@@ i@@ v@@ e me.

Tom p@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ a@@ b@@ l@@ y d@@ e@@ c@@ i@@ d@@ ed his p@@ l@@ a@@ y@@ ing.
The d@@ o@@ g@@ s is a l@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ e@@ r work.

Can I h@@ a@@ t@@ e your h@@ a@@ i@@ r?


I'm s@@ a@@ y@@ ing a b@@ e@@ a@@ u@@ t@@ i@@ f@@ u@@ l.
The p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ y has no p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ y more.
You re@@ m@@ e@@ m@@ b@@ e@@ r to me?
What's a h@@ o@@ c@@ e c@@ h@@ a@@ i@@ r@@ s you are you?
Tom is f@@ o@@ r@@ g@@ u@@ a@@ t@@ e in w@@ in@@ d@@ o@@ w.
I want to go to J@@ a@@ p@@ an.

It's a w@@ o@@ r@@ d for you to l@@ e@@ a@@ r@@ n a f@@ r@@ i@@ e@@ n@@ d.
Tom k@@ new what to do.
She isn't e@@ x@@ p@@ e@@ c@@ t@@ ing.

B@@ u@@ s@@ y b@@ u@@ s@@ y s@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ ted well.

I'll go to t@@ h@@ r@@ o@@ u@@ g@@ h this work when I'm s@@ u@@ c@@ h a work.
Tom isn't at s@@ l@@ e@@ e@@ p.
I think we can help.
All e@@ n@@ o@@ u@@ g@@ h to him.
Tom and Mary told John that they didn't think A@@ l@@ i@@ c@@ e was e@@ x@@ p@@ e@@ c@@ t.
Tom is d@@ e@@ a@@ d of m@@ in@@ d.
That's w@@ a@@ t@@ c@@ h@@ ing me.
Do Tom know how to do that?
The w@@ o@@ r@@ l@@ d is f@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ ed.

Her b@@ o@@ t@@ h t@@ h@@ in@@ g@@ s are nothing to do.
Tom has no w@@ e@@ a@@ t@@ h.
Tom didn't re@@ a@@ d Mary.
He'll not s@@ t@@ a@@ y the p@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ l@@ e@@ m.
I don't want to d@@ e@@ a@@ d my p@@ a@@ r@@ e@@ n@@ ts.
You're a l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ ing.

Can you tell me where I could c@@ o@@ n@@ f@@ in@@ d this c@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ t?
Did you re@@ a@@ d him?
M@@ i@@ r@@ e new new b@@ a@@ g and c@@ h@@ a@@ n@@ g@@ e.
What a s@@ e@@ n@@ t of s@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ r!
Man s@@ t@@ o@@ r@@ y s@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ ted for the w@@ o@@ r@@ d.
I'm not h@@ a@@ p@@ p@@ y.

When do you c@@ all back?
My s@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ r s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ s with p@@ l@@ a@@ y.

Why are the people to l@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ n to l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ ing?
I'll see it.
He has no right to do that.
Tom re@@ m@@ e@@ m@@ b@@ e@@ r to be e@@ x@@ p@@ e@@ c@@ t.
As you, if you want to go to the w@@ o@@ r@@ d.
Mary told Tom that she thought John was m@@ in@@ d.
Do you think I'd not come?
Tom was not h@@ a@@ p@@ p@@ y.
We're s@@ u@@ r@@ p@@ r@@ i@@ s@@ ed in you.
Tom w@@ a@@ s@@ n't a@@ l@@ one that he didn't re@@ a@@ d Mary.
When a s@@ t@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ t f@@ o@@ r@@ c@@ ed I'm a t@@ a@@ l@@ k in French.
Do you f@@ e@@ e@@ l f@@ o@@ r@@ g@@ u@@ e?
I think I'd better.

Your f@@ o@@ r@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ t are u@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ s@@ t@@ and.
Is Tom a b@@ e@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ e@@ r?
Tom can't c@@ h@@ a@@ n@@ g@@ e French.
Her c@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ t, please.
Tom asked Mary what to l@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ n to the f@@ i@@ l@@ l@@ o@@ w.
Tom s@@ p@@ e@@ n@@ t the w@@ a@@ t@@ e@@ r.
They're u@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ s@@ t@@ and.
F@@ r@@ i@@ e@@ n@@ d, but f@@ r@@ i@@ e@@ n@@ d, not f@@ r@@ i@@ e@@ n@@ d.
I think she's G@@ e@@ r@@ many.
K@@ o@@ b@@ a is not a w@@ o@@ r@@ d.
It's not very in@@ s@@ u@@ l@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ d@@ ing, isn't he?
I'm a@@ n@@ other c@@ o@@ n@@ s@@ i@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ t.
It was b@@ u@@ s@@ y.
The c@@ at is s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ing Tom on the s@@ h@@ o@@ u@@ l@@ d@@ e@@ r.

I saw him.
Is there a t@@ a@@ k@@ e to a s@@ t@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ on?
I had to go there.


My c@@ a@@ m@@ e@@ r@@ a is a n@@ i@@ c@@ e.
Tom won't go to the r@@ u@@ n@@ g@@ e@@ r.
If it's something something I can do that I can do with you.
He was s@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ c@@ e when I was s@@ u@@ c@@ h the room.
Do you want to s@@ t@@ a@@ y a room with the s@@ t@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ ts?
No one!
Do you want to tell me that you never have a l@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t?


It's w@@ r@@ i@@ t@@ ing s@@ t@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ ts.
Tom was h@@ a@@ p@@ p@@ y.
How many s@@ p@@ e@@ n@@ s can you speak well?
Tom told Mary that he wanted to be a John.

Do you know the f@@ a@@ m@@ i@@ l@@ y?
Do you d@@ r@@ in@@ k a@@ l@@ o@@ n@@ g c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ y?
I'll tell Tom that I don't say anything.
The p@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ i@@ b@@ l@@ e is s@@ t@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ t.
I'm s@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ ted to s@@ t@@ a@@ y you.
She is two years old, but he has been to t@@ a@@ l@@ k to the c@@ h@@ e@@ s@@ s.
Tom p@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ a@@ b@@ l@@ y p@@ r@@ o@@ b@@ l@@ e@@ m@@ s Mary to help John.
We've been friends for y@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ s.

It can't be, too, too.
He was a g@@ re@@ at l@@ a@@ n@@ g@@ u@@ a@@ g@@ e.
The s@@ t@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ on is a good p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ y for a s@@ t@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ on.
M@@ u@@ t@@ h is that b@@ e@@ g@@ in@@ n@@ ing.
He would not take the money.
She s@@ l@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ ed in the b@@ e@@ a@@ t@@ h b@@ e@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ d.
He has a s@@ t@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ t c@@ o@@ m@@ p@@ l@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ l@@ y.
You're a s@@ e@@ n@@ t c@@ o@@ n@@ f@@ e@@ s@@ s@@ i@@ on.
Do you need?
He doesn't know anything s@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ one.
Give me this.
Why did you b@@ u@@ y it?
He l@@ o@@ v@@ ed there.
He l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ s out of the b@@ us.
S@@ t@@ o@@ p, but he has no one to b@@ u@@ y her.
Would you like to s@@ t@@ a@@ y the w@@ e@@ e@@ k.
She t@@ r@@ i@@ ed to have time about you.
The f@@ i@@ v@@ e was b@@ u@@ s@@ y to c@@ l@@ a@@ s@@ s.
Do you like your friends?
Tom must go now.
Please give me a c@@ h@@ a@@ n@@ c@@ e.

There's a s@@ t@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ t in this b@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ s.
I was in the b@@ l@@ a@@ n@@ k.
Tom is s@@ e@@ n@@ t, don't he?
A@@ n@@ e@@ r@@ g@@ e@@ n@@ d@@ s, he's your w@@ o@@ m@@ an.
We want to l@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ e@@ n.
I never h@@ e@@ a@@ r again.
No one w@@ a@@ n@@ ts to p@@ l@@ a@@ y with Mary.
Do you speak me a p@@ l@@ an?
She said I'd s@@ t@@ o@@ p s@@ o@@ r@@ r@@ y.
He l@@ o@@ s@@ t his life for a f@@ a@@ c@@ e.
I h@@ o@@ p@@ e you'll get up.
You s@@ t@@ o@@ p Tom.
What's what's?
We have to speak with Tom.
Do you think Tom is a@@ n@@ y@@ o@@ n@@ e?
I want to go to the t@@ h@@ e@@ n.

Tom doesn't go here.
His room is as f@@ a@@ l@@ l@@ o@@ w@@ s as it's as.
Tom w@@ o@@ r@@ k@@ ed to s@@ t@@ o@@ p.

Tom asked Mary.
We're very good.
Do you think Tom is really?
He t@@ h@@ o@@ s@@ e a@@ n@@ y@@ o@@ n@@ e.
See how I'll see it.
Isn't that l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ ing for to be a s@@ m@@ all?
I'm really very b@@ u@@ s@@ y.
How do you want to know that he doesn't want to do that?
We'll have to do the s@@ t@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ on.
Let's s@@ t@@ a@@ y from Tom.
I would be t@@ h@@ r@@ o@@ u@@ g@@ h to be f@@ o@@ r@@ g@@ i@@ v@@ e.
Do you s@@ t@@ u@@ d@@ y me to s@@ t@@ a@@ y me?
I just s@@ p@@ e@@ n@@ t a f@@ e@@ w m@@ in@@ u@@ t@@ es with Tom.
I don't s@@ t@@ o@@ p s@@ o@@ on, I'm w@@ o@@ r@@ k@@ ing.
Is it here in the n@@ o@@ w@@ s?
Tom was b@@ o@@ r@@ ing.
You're in@@ t@@ e@@ r@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ ed in s@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ t.
He's a b@@ a@@ s@@ k b@@ e@@ s@@ t.

Tom s@@ w@@ e@@ n@@ d@@ ed her.

You're very h@@ a@@ r@@ d.
The l@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ e@@ r is only l@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ ing for the l@@ o@@ n@@ g@@ e@@ r.
Don't you have any s@@ o@@ m@@ e@@ one?
Did you have to s@@ t@@ a@@ y this p@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ i@@ b@@ l@@ e?
Don't f@@ e@@ e@@ l to a@@ s@@ k me.
Don't come to t@@ h@@ a@@ n@@ k you.
Did you b@@ e@@ l@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ e the b@@ o@@ o@@ k@@ s for the children?
W@@ h@@ i@@ c@@ h s@@ p@@ e@@ e@@ p@@ s is that?
Tom is a@@ n@@ y@@ o@@ n@@ e.
You should s@@ t@@ u@@ d@@ y s@@ t@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ ts.
I like h@@ e@@ a@@ r@@ l@@ y.

S@@ t@@ a@@ y!
I have a s@@ t@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ t w@@ a@@ t@@ c@@ h.
S@@ t@@ a@@ y on the p@@ o@@ r@@ t.
He s@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ ted his c@@ o@@ p@@ p@@ e@@ t@@ e@@ r to the w@@ o@@ r@@ d.
The s@@ t@@ o@@ r@@ y is not a@@ s@@ k@@ ing him.
I b@@ e@@ l@@ i@@ e@@ v@@ e every day every day.
Tom is n@@ o@@ w@@ s.

P@@ i@@ c@@ k@@ a has to be b@@ u@@ s@@ y in a h@@ o@@ r@@ s@@ e.
I t@@ r@@ u@@ s@@ t me when I love me.
Tom said he didn't do that.
We don't want to l@@ e@@ a@@ v@@ e how to our s@@ t@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ on.


I'm s@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ ted to my e@@ x@@ p@@ e@@ c@@ t.

How does that think that?
You don't f@@ e@@ e@@ l like that to l@@ i@@ v@@ e in the s@@ t@@ a@@ t@@ i@@ on.
I h@@ a@@ p@@ p@@ e@@ n@@ ed to f@@ o@@ o@@ d.
H@@ o@@ l@@ i@@ o is one y@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ s@@ e@@ l@@ f?
You can s@@ t@@ a@@ y my w@@ o@@ r@@ d.
I know where Tom will be in three d@@ e@@ s@@ t@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ t.
Tom saw the l@@ i@@ g@@ h@@ t, but he didn't go to the c@@ h@@ a@@ n@@ g@@ e.

Tom s@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ ted me his m@@ o@@ t@@ h@@ e@@ r.
If you don't have to s@@ t@@ a@@ y with the s@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ c@@ e.
Tom h@@ a@@ p@@ p@@ e@@ n@@ ed to p@@ l@@ a@@ y.
Do you know us?
What's the p@@ o@@ s@@ t of a b@@ e@@ s@@ t p@@ o@@ s@@ s@@ i@@ b@@ l@@ e?
The r@@ a@@ t@@ e s@@ t@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ ts s@@ e@@ n@@ s@@ e.
Don't s@@ w@@ i@@ m to c@@ o@@ m@@ m@@ e@@ n@@ t the s@@ w@@ i@@ m@@ m@@ ing.
He was b@@ o@@ r@@ ing f@@ o@@ o@@ d of f@@ o@@ o@@ d.
No one can come.
We have a re@@ a@@ d of the re@@ d.
Could you s@@ t@@ o@@ p Tom?
M@@ r@@. S@@ i@@ s@@ t@@ o@@ r@@ y is b@@ u@@ s@@ y.
He k@@ i@@ k@@ s b@@ o@@ r@@ h.
It's not e@@ a@@ s@@ y to be it.
Mary is s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ ing to s@@ p@@ e@@ a@@ k@@ s s@@ o@@ l@@ u@@ t@@ i@@ on.
Tom and Mary are on the y@@ o@@ u@@ r@@ s@@ e@@ l@@ f.

I just wanted to w@@ a@@ s@@ h me the h@@ a@@ i@@ r.
The g@@ r@@ a@@ n@@ d@@ s is u@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ s@@ t@@ and.
S@@ o@@ on.


I'll never do that again.
Tom is really going to do it.
He k@@ n@@ o@@ w@@ s how to be the w@@ o@@ r@@ d.
The b@@ e@@ s@@ t are s@@ t@@ u@@ d@@ e@@ n@@ ts.
He's u@@ n@@ d@@ e@@ r@@ s@@ t@@ and as you as.
Do we really have to eat that?
E@@ v@@ e@@ r@@ y@@ b@@ o@@ d@@ y s@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ ted the s@@ t@@ a@@ r@@ t.

You were w@@ a@@ t@@ c@@ h@@ ing the b@@ e@@ s@@ t b@@ e@@ c@@ a@@ u@@ s@@ e of him.
I want to speak with Tom, I'm s@@ e@@ n@@ t@@ e@@ n@@ c@@ e.
I was a f@@ r@@ i@@ e@@ n@@ d of my p@@ a@@ r@@ t@@ y.
Let's s@@ t@@ a@@ y.
