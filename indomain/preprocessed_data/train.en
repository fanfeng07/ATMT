Note : at present , this restriction only applies to situations in which aptitude &apos;s dependency resolver ( the red bar at the bottom of the screen ) is activated. aptitude will still break holds when automatically installing the dependencies of a package that has just been selected for installation or upgrade , due to apt bug # 470035 .

EXPR True if expr is false . expr1 -a EXPR2 True if both expr1 AND expr2 are true . expr1 -o EXPR2 True if either expr1 OR expr2 is true. arg1 OP arg2 Arithmetic tests .

parse option arguments . getopts is used by shell procedures to parse positional parameters as options . OPTSTRING contains the option letters to be recognized ; if a letter is followed by a colon , the option is expected to have an argument , which should be separated from it by white space . each time it is invoked , getopts will place the next option in the shell variable $ name , initializing name if it does not exist , and the index of the next argument to be processed into the shell variable OPTIND . OPTIND is initialized to 1 each time the shell or a shell script is invoked . when an option requires an argument , getopts places that argument into the shell variable OPTARG. getopts reports errors in one of two ways . if the first character of OPTSTRING is a colon , getopts uses silent error reporting . in this mode , no error messages are printed . if an invalid option is seen , getopts places the option character found into OPTARG . if a required argument is not found , getopts places a &apos; : &apos; into NAME and sets OPTARG to the option character found . if getopts is not in silent mode , and an invalid option is seen , getopts places &apos; ? &apos; into NAME and unsets OPTARG . if a required argument is not found , a &apos; ? &apos; is placed in NAME , OPTARG is unset , and a diagnostic message is printed . if the shell variable OPTERR has the value 0 , getopts disables the printing of error messages , even if the first character of OPTSTRING is not a colon . OPTERR has the value 1 by default . getopts normally parses the positional parameters ( $ 0 - $ 9 ) , but if more arguments are given , they are parsed instead . exit Status : returns success if an option is found ; fails if the end of options is encountered or an error occurs .
