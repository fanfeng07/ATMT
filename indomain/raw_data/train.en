Read a line from the standard input and split it into fields. Reads a single line from the standard input, or from file descriptor FD if the -u option is supplied. The line is split into fields as with word splitting, and the first word is assigned to the first NAME, the second word to the second NAME, and so on, with any leftover words assigned to the last NAME. Only the characters found in $IFS are recognized as word delimiters. If no NAMEs are supplied, the line read is stored in the REPLY variable. Options: -a array\tassign the words read to sequential indices of the array \t\tvariable ARRAY, starting at zero -d delim\tcontinue until the first character of DELIM is read, rather \t\tthan newline -e\t\tuse Readline to obtain the line in an interactive shell -i text\tUse TEXT as the initial text for Readline -n nchars\treturn after reading NCHARS characters rather than waiting \t\tfor a newline, but honor a delimiter if fewer than NCHARS \t\tcharacters are read before the delimiter -N nchars\treturn only after reading exactly NCHARS characters, unless \t\tEOF is encountered or read times out, ignoring any delimiter -p prompt\toutput the string PROMPT without a trailing newline before \t\tattempting to read -r\t\tdo not allow backslashes to escape any characters -s\t\tdo not echo input coming from a terminal -t timeout\ttime out and return failure if a complete line of input is \t\tnot read withint TIMEOUT seconds.

Define or display aliases. Without arguments, `alias' prints the list of aliases in the reusable form `alias NAME=VALUE' on standard output. Otherwise, an alias is defined for each NAME whose VALUE is given. A trailing space in VALUE causes the next word to be checked for alias substitution when the alias is expanded. Options: -p\tPrint all defined aliases in a reusable format Exit Status: alias returns true unless a NAME is supplied for which no alias has been defined.
If this option is enabled, then whenever aptitude solves a dependency problem, it will consider modifying held packages, or installing forbidden package versions. With this option disabled, these solutions will be rejected by default. NOTE: At present, this restriction only applies to situations in which aptitude's dependency resolver (the red bar at the bottom of the screen) is activated. aptitude will still break holds when automatically installing the dependencies of a package that has just been selected for installation or upgrade, due to apt bug #470035.

Remove directories from stack. Removes entries from the directory stack. With no arguments, removes the top directory from the stack, and changes to the new top directory. Options: -n\tSuppresses the normal change of directory when removing \tdirectories from the stack, so only the stack is manipulated. Arguments: +N\tRemoves the Nth entry counting from the left of the list \tshown by `dirs', starting with zero. For example: `popd +0' \tremoves the first directory, `popd +1' the second. -N\tRemoves the Nth entry counting from the right of the list \tshown by `dirs', starting with zero. For example: `popd -0' \tremoves the last directory, `popd -1' the next to last. The `dirs' builtin displays the directory stack. Exit Status: Returns success unless an invalid argument is supplied or the directory change fails.

Evaluate arithmetic expressions. Evaluate each ARG as an arithmetic expression. Evaluation is done in fixed-width integers with no check for overflow, though division by 0 is trapped and flagged as an error. The following list of operators is grouped into levels of equal-precedence operators. The levels are listed in order of decreasing precedence. \tid++, id--\tvariable post-increment, post-decrement \t++id, --id\tvariable pre-increment, pre-decrement \t-, +\t\tunary minus, plus \t!, ~\t\tlogical and bitwise negation \t**\t\texponentiation \t*, /, %\t\tmultiplication, division, remainder \t+, -\t\taddition, subtraction \t<>\t\tleft and right bitwise shifts \t=, \tcomparison \t==, !=\t\tequality, inequality \t\t\tbitwise AND \t^\t\tbitwise XOR \t_BAR_\t\tbitwise OR \t&\t\tlogical AND \t_BAR__BAR_\t\tlogical OR \texpr ? expr : expr \t\t\tconditional operator \t=, *=, /=, %=, \t+=, -=, <>=, \t=, ^=, _BAR_=\tassignment Shell variables are allowed as operands. The name of the variable is replaced by its value (coerced to a fixed-width integer) within an expression. The variable need not have its integer attribute turned on to be used in an expression. Operators are evaluated in order of precedence. Sub-expressions in parentheses are evaluated first and may override the precedence rules above. Exit Status: If the last ARG evaluates to 0, let returns 1; let returns 0 otherwise.

eMusic Files
Evaluate conditional expression. Exits with a status of 0 (true) or 1 (false) depending on the evaluation of EXPR. Expressions may be unary or binary. Unary expressions are often used to examine the status of a file. There are string operators and numeric comparison operators as well. The behavior of test depends on the number of arguments. Read the bash manual page for the complete specification. File operators: -a FILE True if file exists. -b FILE True if file is block special. -c FILE True if file is character special. -d FILE True if file is a directory. -e FILE True if file exists. -f FILE True if file exists and is a regular file. -g FILE True if file is set-group-id. -h FILE True if file is a symbolic link. -L FILE True if file is a symbolic link. -k FILE True if file has its `sticky' bit set. -p FILE True if file is a named pipe. -r FILE True if file is readable by you. -s FILE True if file exists and is not empty. -S FILE True if file is a socket. -t FD True if FD is opened on a terminal. -u FILE True if the file is set-user-id. -w FILE True if the file is writable by you. -x FILE True if the file is executable by you. -O FILE True if the file is effectively owned by you. -G FILE True if the file is effectively owned by your group. -N FILE True if the file has been modified since it was last read. FILE1 -nt FILE2 True if file1 is newer than file2 (according to modification date). FILE1 -ot FILE2 True if file1 is older than file2. FILE1 -ef FILE2 True if file1 is a hard link to file2. String operators: -z STRING True if string is empty. -n STRING STRING True if string is not empty. STRING1 = STRING2 True if the strings are equal. STRING1 != STRING2 True if the strings are not equal. STRING1 STRING2 True if STRING1 sorts after STRING2 lexicographically. Other operators: -o OPTION True if the shell option OPTION is enabled. -v VAR\t True if the shell variable VAR is set ! EXPR True if expr is false. EXPR1 -a EXPR2 True if both expr1 AND expr2 are true. EXPR1 -o EXPR2 True if either expr1 OR expr2 is true. arg1 OP arg2 Arithmetic tests. OP is one of -eq, -ne, -lt, -le, -gt, or -ge. Arithmetic binary operators return true if ARG1 is equal, not-equal, less-than, less-than-or-equal, greater-than, or greater-than-or-equal than ARG2. Exit Status: Returns success if EXPR evaluates to true; fails if EXPR evaluates to false or an invalid argument is given.

Display or execute commands from the history list. fc is used to list or edit and re-execute commands from the history list. FIRST and LAST can be numbers specifying the range, or FIRST can be a string, which means the most recent command beginning with that string. Options: -e ENAME\tselect which editor to use. Default is FCEDIT, then EDITOR, \t\tthen vi -l \tlist lines instead of editing -n\tomit line numbers when listing -r\treverse the order of the lines (newest listed first) With the `fc -s [pat=rep ...] [command]' format, COMMAND is re-executed after the substitution OLD=NEW is performed. A useful alias to use with this is r='fc -s', so that typing `r cc' runs the last command beginning with `cc' and typing `r' re-executes the last command. Exit Status: Returns success or status of executed command; non-zero if an error occurs.

Change the shell working directory. Change the current directory to DIR. The default DIR is the value of the HOME shell variable. The variable CDPATH defines the search path for the directory containing DIR. Alternative directory names in CDPATH are separated by a colon (:). A null directory name is the same as the current directory. If DIR begins with a slash (/), then CDPATH is not used. If the directory is not found, and the shell option `cdable_vars' is set, the word is assumed to be a variable name. If that variable has a value, its value is used for DIR. Options: -L\tforce symbolic links to be followed -P\tuse the physical directory structure without following symbolic \tlinks -e\tif the -P option is supplied, and the current working directory \tcannot be determined successfully, exit with a non-zero status The default is to follow symbolic links, as if `-L' were specified. Exit Status: Returns 0 if the directory is changed, and if $PWD is set successfully when -P is used; non-zero otherwise.

Usage: apt-ftparchive [options] command Commands: packages binarypath [overridefile [pathprefix]] sources srcpath [overridefile [pathprefix]] contents path release path generate config [groups] clean config apt-ftparchive generates index files for Debian archives. It supports many styles of generation from fully automated to functional replacements for dpkg-scanpackages and dpkg-scansources apt-ftparchive generates Package files from a tree of .debs. The Package file contains the contents of all the control fields from each package as well as the MD5 hash and filesize. An override file is supported to force the value of Priority and Section. Similarly apt-ftparchive generates Sources files from a tree of .dscs. The --source-override option can be used to specify a src override file The 'packages' and 'sources' command should be run in the root of the tree. BinaryPath should point to the base of the recursive search and override file should contain the override flags. Pathprefix is appended to the filename fields if present. Example usage from the Debian archive: apt-ftparchive packages dists/potato/main/binary-i386/ > \\ dists/potato/main/binary-i386/Packages Options: -h This help text --md5 Control MD5 generation -s=?

Unexpected Client Job message: %s
Parse option arguments. Getopts is used by shell procedures to parse positional parameters as options. OPTSTRING contains the option letters to be recognized; if a letter is followed by a colon, the option is expected to have an argument, which should be separated from it by white space. Each time it is invoked, getopts will place the next option in the shell variable $name, initializing name if it does not exist, and the index of the next argument to be processed into the shell variable OPTIND. OPTIND is initialized to 1 each time the shell or a shell script is invoked. When an option requires an argument, getopts places that argument into the shell variable OPTARG. getopts reports errors in one of two ways. If the first character of OPTSTRING is a colon, getopts uses silent error reporting. In this mode, no error messages are printed. If an invalid option is seen, getopts places the option character found into OPTARG. If a required argument is not found, getopts places a ':' into NAME and sets OPTARG to the option character found. If getopts is not in silent mode, and an invalid option is seen, getopts places '?' into NAME and unsets OPTARG. If a required argument is not found, a '?' is placed in NAME, OPTARG is unset, and a diagnostic message is printed. If the shell variable OPTERR has the value 0, getopts disables the printing of error messages, even if the first character of OPTSTRING is not a colon. OPTERR has the value 1 by default. Getopts normally parses the positional parameters ($0 - $9), but if more arguments are given, they are parsed instead. Exit Status: Returns success if an option is found; fails if the end of options is encountered or an error occurs.

Variables with the integer attribute have arithmetic evaluation (see the `let' command) performed when the variable is assigned a value. When used in a function, `declare' makes NAMEs local, as with the `local' command. The `-g' option suppresses this behavior.

Advanced Strategic Command
Trap signals and other events. Defines and activates handlers to be run when the shell receives signals or other conditions. ARG is a command to be read and executed when the shell receives the signal(s) SIGNAL_SPEC. If ARG is absent (and a single SIGNAL_SPEC is supplied) or `-', each specified signal is reset to its original value. If ARG is the null string each SIGNAL_SPEC is ignored by the shell and by the commands it invokes. If a SIGNAL_SPEC is EXIT (0) ARG is executed on exit from the shell. If a SIGNAL_SPEC is DEBUG, ARG is executed before every simple command. If a SIGNAL_SPEC is RETURN, ARG is executed each time a shell function or a script run by the . or source builtins finishes executing. A SIGNAL_SPEC of ERR means to execute ARG each time a command's failure would cause the shell to exit when the -e option is enabled. If no arguments are supplied, trap prints the list of commands associated with each signal. Options: -l\tprint a list of signal names and their corresponding numbers -p\tdisplay the trap commands associated with each SIGNAL_SPEC Each SIGNAL_SPEC is either a signal name in <signal\.h> or a signal number. Signal names are case insensitive and the SIG prefix is optional. A signal may be sent to the shell with "kill -signal $$". Exit Status: Returns success unless a SIGSPEC is invalid or an invalid option is given.
