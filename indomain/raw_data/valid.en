Enable and disable shell builtins. Enables and disables builtin shell commands. Disabling allows you to execute a disk command which has the same name as a shell builtin without using a full pathname. Options: -a\tprint a list of builtins showing whether or not each is enabled -n\tdisable each NAME or display a list of disabled builtins -p\tprint the list of builtins in a reusable format -s\tprint only the names of Posix `special' builtins Options controlling dynamic loading: -f\tLoad builtin NAME from shared object FILENAME -d\tRemove a builtin loaded with -f Without options, each NAME is enabled. To use the `test' found in $PATH instead of the shell builtin version, type `enable -n test'. Exit Status: Returns success unless NAME is not a shell builtin or an error occurs.

Add directories to stack. Adds a directory to the top of the directory stack, or rotates the stack, making the new top of the stack the current working directory. With no arguments, exchanges the top two directories. Options: -n\tSuppresses the normal change of directory when adding \tdirectories to the stack, so only the stack is manipulated. Arguments: +N\tRotates the stack so that the Nth directory (counting \tfrom the left of the list shown by `dirs', starting with \tzero) is at the top. -N\tRotates the stack so that the Nth directory (counting \tfrom the right of the list shown by `dirs', starting with \tzero) is at the top. dir\tAdds DIR to the directory stack at the top, making it the \tnew current working directory. The `dirs' builtin displays the directory stack. Exit Status: Returns success unless an invalid argument is supplied or the directory change fails.

Set Readline key bindings and variables. Bind a key sequence to a Readline function or a macro, or set a Readline variable. The non-option argument syntax is equivalent to that found in ~/.inputrc, but must be passed as a single argument: e.g., bind '"\\C-x\\C-r": re-read-init-file'. Options: -m keymap Use KEYMAP as the keymap for the duration of this command. Acceptable keymap names are emacs, emacs-standard, emacs-meta, emacs-ctlx, vi, vi-move, vi-command, and vi-insert. -l List names of functions. -P List function names and bindings. -p List functions and bindings in a form that can be reused as input. -S List key sequences that invoke macros and their values -s List key sequences that invoke macros and their values in a form that can be reused as input. -V List variable names and values -v List variable names and values in a form that can be reused as input. -q function-name Query about which keys invoke the named function. -u function-name Unbind all keys which are bound to the named function. -r keyseq Remove the binding for KEYSEQ. -f filename Read key bindings from FILENAME. -x keyseq:shell-command\tCause SHELL-COMMAND to be executed when \t\t\t\tKEYSEQ is entered. Exit Status: bind returns 0 unless an unrecognized option is given or an error occurs.
